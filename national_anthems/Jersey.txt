1. 
Ours is an Island home

Firm on rock and strong by sea

Loyal and proud in history,

Our thankful hearts are

Raised to God for Jersey.




2. 
The beauty of this land

Long inspires both eye and mind.

Ours the privilege to guard its shore

So help we God that

Jersey might through grace endure.
