1. 
Let’s raise our voice and sing

the grandeur of Curaçao;

Curaçao, small island,

a boulder in the sea!



Curaçao we love you

above all nations.

Your glory we sing

with all our hearts.




2. 
Our people have their struggle

but we always have our faith

to accomplish always

victory through labour!



Let us give our share

for the island to prosper.

Let us unite forces

so we can triumph.




3. 
To our fatherland we demonstrate

honour and loyalty,

as we do to the flag

the union of our nation.



Our lives would be little

to give for our country,

fighting united for liberty,

love and understanding.




4. 
And when we are far from home

we all recall

Curaçao, its sun and beaches

the pride of us all.



Let us praise our Creator

always and forever,

for He has made us worthy

to be Curaçaoan!¹
