1. 
Against the humiliating bondage of a thousand years

Rapacity came from afar to subjugate them for a hundred years.

Against the cynical malice in the shape

Of neo-colonialism and its petty local servants.

Many gave in and certain others resisted.

But the frustrations, the successes, the sweat, the blood

Have fortified our courageous people and fertilized its heroic struggle. 




CHORUS:
  
And one single night has drawn together

The history of an entire people,

And one single night has launched its triumphal march.

Towards the horizon of good fortune.

One single night has brought together our people

With all the peoples of the World,

In the acquisition of liberty and progress.

Motherland or death, we shall conquer.




2. 
Nourished in the lively source of the Revolution,

The volunteers for liberty and peace

With their nocturnal and beneficial energies of the 4 of August

Had not only hand arms, but also and above all

The flame in their hearts lawfully to free

Faso forever from the fetters of those who

Here and there were polluting the sacred soul of independence and sovereignty. 


Chorus




3. 
And seated henceforth in rediscovered dignity,

Love and honour partnered with humanity,

The people of Burkina sing a victory hymn

To the glory of the work of liberation and emancipation.

Down with exploitation of man by man!

Forward for the good of every man

By all men of today and tomorrow, by every man here and always!


Chorus




4. 
Popular revolution our nourishing sap.

Undying motherhood of progress in the face of man.

Eternal hearth of agreed democracy,

Where at last national identity has the right of freedom.

Where injustice has lost its place forever,

And where from the hands of builders of a glorious world

Everywhere the harvests of patriotic vows ripen and suns of boundless joy shine.


Chorus
