1. 
Sound, all of you, your Koras, 

Beat the drums, 

The red Lion has roared,

The Tamer of the bush with one leap has rushed forward

Scattering the gloom.

Light on our terrors,

Light on our hopes.

Arise, brothers, behold Africa united!




CHORUS:

Fibres of my green heart.

Shoulder to shoulder,

O people of Senegal, more than brothers to me, arise!

Unite the sea and the springs,

Unite the steppe and the forest!

Hail, mother Africa,

Hail, mother Africa! 




2. 
Senegal, thou son of the Lion

Arise in the night with great speed,

Restore, oh, restore to us the honour of our ancestors,

Magnificent as ebony and strong as muscles!

We are a straight people-the sword has no fault.




Chorus




3. 
Senegal, we make your great design our own:

To gather the chicks, sheltering them from kites,

To make from them, from East to West, from North to South,

A people rising as one, in seamless unity,

Yet a people facing all the winds of the earth.




Chorus




4. 
Senegal, like thee, like all our heroes,

We will be stern without hatred, and with open arms.

The sword we will put peacefully in its sheath,

For work and words will be our weapon.

The Bantu is our brother, the Arab, and the White man too.




Chorus




5. 
But if the enemy violates our frontiers,

We will all be ready, weapons in our hands;

A people in its faith defying all evil;

Young and old, men and women,

Death, yes! but not dishonour.  




Chorus
