1. 
We, the Belarusians, peaceful people,

Our heart is to our native land,

We maintain generous friendship and gain our powers

Within the industrious, free family.




CHORUS:
  
Glory to the bright name of our land,

Glory to the fraternal union of our peoples!

Our beloved mother-Motherland,

Long you live and flourish, Belarus!




2. 
Together with brothers, with fortitude, during centuries

We guarded our native thresholds,

In struggles for freedom, in struggles for fate,

We have been gaining our banner of victories.


Chorus




3. 
The friendship of peoples (which is) the power of peoples

Is our venerable, sunny path

You soar up proudly, into the bright heights,

The banner of victory, the banner of joy!


Chorus
