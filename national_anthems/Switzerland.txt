1. 
When the morning skies grow red 

And o’er their radiance shed, 

Thou, O Lord, appeareth in their light. 

When the Alps glow bright with splendour, 

Pray to God, to Him surrender, 

For you feel and understand, 

For you feel and understand, 

That he dwelleth in this land. 

That he dwelleth in this land. 




2. 
In the sunset Thou art nigh 

And beyond the starry sky, 

Thou, O loving Father, ever near 

When to Heaven we are departing, 

Joy and bliss Thou’lt be imparting, 

For we feel and understand 

For we feel and understand 

That Thou dwellest in this land. 

That Thou dwellest in this land. 




3. 
When dark clouds enshroud the hills 

And gray mist the valley fills, 

Yet Thou art not hidden from Thy sons. 

Pierce the gloom in which we cower 

With Thy sunshine’s cleansing power 

Then we’ll feel and understand 

Then we’ll feel and understand 

That God dwelleth in this land. 

That God dwelleth in this land. 




4. 
Towards us in the wild storm coming,

You yourself give us resistance and stronghold,

You, almighty ruling, rescuing!

During horror and nights of thunderstorms

Let us childlike trust Him!

Yes, we feel and understand;

Yes, we feel and understand

That God dwelleth in this land.

That God dwelleth in this land.
