Soldiers are we whose lives are pledged to Ireland;

Some have come from a land beyond the wave,

Sworn to be free,

No more our ancient sire land

Shall shelter the despot or the slave.

Tonight we man the 
bearna bhaoil

In Erin’s cause, come woe or weal,

‘Mid cannons’ roar and rifles peal,

We’ll chant a soldier’s song.
