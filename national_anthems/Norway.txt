1. 
Yes, we love this country

as it rises forth,

rugged, weathered, above the sea,

with the thousands of homes.

Love, love it and think

of our father and mother

and the saga night that sends

dreams to our earth.

2. 
This country Harald united

with his army of heroes,

this country Håkon protected

whilst Øyvind sung;

upon the country Olav painted

with his blood the cross,

from its heights Sverre spoke

up against Rome.

from its heights Sverre spoke

spoke up against Rome.




3. 
Farmers their axes sharpened

wherever an army advanced,

Tordenskiold along the coastline thundered

so that we could see it back home.

Even women stood up and fought

as if they were men;

others could only cry

but that soon would end!

others could only cry

but that soon, that soon would end!




4. 
Sure, we were not many

but we were enough,

when we were tested sometimes,

and it was at stake;

we would rather burn our land

than to declare defeat;

just remember what happened

down at Fredrikshald!

just remember what happened

what happened down at Fredrikshald!




5. 
Hard times we have coped with,

were at last disowned;

but in the worst distress, blue-eyed

freedom was to us born.

It gave (us) father’s strength to carry

famine and war,

it gave death itself its honour –

and it gave reconciliation.

it gave death itself its honour –

and it gave, it gave reconciliation.




6. 
The enemy threw away his weapon,

up the visor went,

we, in wonder, to him hastened,

because he was our brother.

Driven forth to a stand by shame

we went to the south;

now we three brothers stand united,

and shall stand like that!

now we three brothers stand united,

united, and shall stand like that!




7. 
Norseman in house and cabin,

thank your great God!

The country he wanted to protect,

although things looked dark.

All the fights fathers have fought,

and the mothers have wept,

the Lord has quietly moved

so we won our rights.

the Lord has quietly moved

so we won, we won our rights.




8. 
Yes, we love this country

as it rises forth,

rugged, weathered, above the sea,

with those thousand homes.

And as the fathers’ struggle has raised

it from need to victory,

even we, when it is demanded,

for its peace, its peace will encamp
