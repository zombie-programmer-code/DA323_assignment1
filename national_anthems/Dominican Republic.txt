1. 
Valients of Quisqueya,

Let us sing with strong feeling

And let us show to the world

Our invincible, glorious banner.



Hail, O people who, strong and intrepid,

Launched into war and went to death!

Under a warlike menace of death,

You broke your chains of slavery.




2. 
No country deserves to be free

If it is an indolent and servile slave,

If the call does not grow loud within it,

Tempered by a virile heroism.



But the brave and indomitable Quisqueya

Will always hold its head high,

For if it were a thousand times enslaved,

It would a thousand times regain liberty.




3. 
If it will be exposed to ruse and deceit

Unto contempt of a real imposer,

On to Las Carreras! Beler! …it were places

Where the traces of glory are found.



Where on the top of the heroic bastion,

The word of the libarated became flesh,

Where the genius of Sánchez and Duarte

Taught to be free or to die.




4. 
And if an unattended leader the splendor

Of these glorious events could ignore,

One has seen in Capotillo in the war

The flag of fire wave.



And the fire that lets the proud lion

Of Castilla become stupefied,

Removes him from the glorious beaches

Where the crossed banner waves.




5. 
Compatriots, let us proudly

Show our face, from today prouder than ever;

Quisqueya may be destroyed

But a slave again, never!



It is a sanctuary of love that every character

Of the fatherland feels alive!

And it is his coat of arms, the right;

And it is his device: be free or die.




6. 
Liberty that still rises cool-bloodedly

The victory in her triumphal car.

And the clarion of war re-echoes

Proclaiming his immortal glory.



Liberty! That the echo’s touch

While they’re full of noble tension

Our fields of glory repeat

Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!
