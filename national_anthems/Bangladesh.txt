My Bengal of gold, I love you.

Forever your skies, your air set my heart in tune as if it were a flute.

In spring, O mother mine, the fragrance from your mango groves makes me wild with joy,

Ah, what a thrill!

In autumn, O mother mine, in the full blossomed paddy fields I have seen spread all over sweet smiles.

Ah, what beauty, what shades, what an affection, and what tenderness!

What a quilt have you spread at the feet of banyan trees and along the banks of rivers!

O mother mine, words from your lips are like nectar to my ears.

Ah, what a thrill!

If sadness, O mother mine, casts a gloom on your face, my eyes are filled with tears!
