1. 
I remember that my beloved mother

Gave me a little bouquet

It has faded long ago

I remember it like it is far away



I remember that my beloved mother

Gave me a little bouquet

It has faded long ago

I remember it like it is far away




CHORUS:

Little faded flower,

Little loved flower

Will you hold me forever, 

Like love?



Little faded flower,

Little loved flower

Will you hold me forever, 

Like love?




2. 
I walked in the forest

It was nice, it was cool

The grass had dew

In the sky a bird singing



I walked in the forest

It was nice, it was cool

The grass had dew

In the sky a bird singing




Chorus




3. 
Since then, time has passed

It remains a sweet memory

When I think, my heart is broken

Everything here below, as it must end



Since then, time has passed

It remains a sweet memory

When I think, my heart is broken

Everything here below, as it must end




Chorus
