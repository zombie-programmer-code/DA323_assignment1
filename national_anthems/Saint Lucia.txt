1. 
Sons and daughters of Saint Lucia 

Love the land that gave us birth. 

Land of beaches, hills and valleys, 

Fairest isle of all the earth.
 
Wheresoever you may roam, 

Love, oh love, our island home. 




2. 
Gone the days when nations battled

For this Helen of the West. 

Gone the days when strife and discord, 

Dimmed her childrenâ€™s toil and rest. 

Dawns at last a brighter day, 

Stretches out a glad new way. 




3. 
May the Good Lord bless our island; 

Guard her sons from woe and harm.
 
May our people, live united, 

Strong in soul and strong in arm. 

Justice, truth and charity, 

Our ideals forever be.
