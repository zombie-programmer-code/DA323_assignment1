1. 
The land of thousand islands and skerries,

Born from deep beneath the waves

Åland, our Åland, our home it is

Thee we long to meet



Ancient graves beneath the birches

Tells of our thousand year history

We will never forget the land of our Fathers

No matter where we will go

No matter where we will go




2. 
Lovely is our Åland when bays and straits

Become blue in the bright days of spring

It’s delightful to wander in forest and grove

In the flowered fields of our shores.



Midsummer pole to evening red sky

Is raised by willing hands

Farthest out in the skerry fisher village

Beacons are lit by the young

Beacons are lit by the young




3. 
Lovely is our Åland when the froth of waves

is whirling against the mighty precipice

When the church folks steer beneath the stars

Over the icy depths of the sea



Even when storm roars, in the cottages’ peace

The song of the spinning wheel is sung

The memory of loving childhood is

Happily praised by the sons

Happily praised by the sons




4. 
Never have Alandian women and men

Let the honour of their tribe down

Warfare threatened us, but victoriously yet

We carry the heritage of freedom



Loudly shall it sound, our Swedish language

Spoken with an urging voice

Enlighten our path like a sea mark of flames

Show us where we belong

Show us where we belong
