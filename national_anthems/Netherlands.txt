1. 
William of Nassau, scion

Of an old Germanic line, 

I dedicate undying

Faith to this land of mine.

A prince I am, undaunted,

Of Orange, ever free,

To the king of Spain I’ve granted

A lifelong loyalty.




2. 
I’ve ever tried to live in
 
The fear of God’s command 

And therefore I’ve been driven
 
From people, home, and land, 

But God, I trust, will rate me 

His willing instrument 

And one day reinstate me 

Into my government.




3. 
Let no despair betray you,
 
My subjects true and good. 

The Lord will surely stay you

Though now you are pursued. 

He who would live devoutly

Must pray God day and night

To throw His power about me

As champion of your right.




4. 
Life and my all for others
 
I sacrificed, for you! 

And my illustrious brothers 

Proved their devotion too. 

Count Adolf, more’s the pity, 

Fell in the Frisian fray, 

And in the eternal city 

Awaits the judgement day.




5. 
I, nobly born, descended
 
From an imperial stock.

An empire’s prince, defended

(Braving the battle’s shock

Heroically and fearless

As pious Christian ought)

With my life’s blood the peerless

Gospel of God our Lord.




6. 
A shield and my reliance,
 
O God, Thou ever wert. 

I’ll trust unto Thy guidance. 

O leave me not ungirt. 

That I may stay a pious.

Servant of Thine for aye

And drive the plagues that try us

And tyranny away.




7. 
My God, I pray thee, save me
 
From all who do pursue 

And threaten to enslave me,

Thy trusted servant true.

O Father, do not sanction

Their wicked, foul design,

Don’t let them wash their hands in

This guiltless blood of mine.




8. 
O David, thou soughtest shelter
 
From King Saul’s tyranny. 

Even so I fled this welter 

And many a lord with me. 

But God the Lord did save him 

From exile and its hell 

And, in His mercy, gave him

A realm in Israel.




9. 
Fear not ‘t will rain sans ceasing
 
The clouds are bound to part. 

I bide that sight so pleasing 

Unto my princely heart,

Which is that I with honour 

Encounter death in war 

And meet in heaven my Donor 

His faithful warrior.




10. 
Nothing so moves my pity
 
As seeing through these lands

Field, village, town and city

Pillaged by roving hands.

O that the Spaniards rape thee

My Netherlands so sweet

The thought of that does grip me

Causing my heart to bleed.




11. 
Astride on steed of mettle 

I’ve waited with my host 

The tyrant’s call to battle 

Who durst not do his boast 

For, near Maastricht ensconced, 

He feared the force I wield 

My horsemen saw one bounce it 

Bravely across the field.




12. 
Surely if God had willed it,
 
When that fierce tempest blew, 

My power would have stilled it

Or turned its blast from you. 

But He who dwells in heaven, 

Whence all our blessings flow, 

For which aye praise be given, 

Did not desire it so.




13. 
Steadfast my heart remaineth
 
In my adversity

My princely courage straineth

All nerves to live and be.

I’ve prayed the Lord my Master

With fervid heart and tense

To save me from disaster

And prove my innocence.




14. 
Alas! my flock. To sever
 
Is hard on us. Farewell.

Your Shepherd wakes, wherever

Dispersed you may dwell.

Pray God that He may ease you.

His gospel be your cure.

Walk in the steps of Jesus

This life will not endure.




15. 
Unto the Lord His power
 
I do confession make 

That ne’er at any hour 

Ill of the king I spake. 

But unto God, the greatest 

Of Majesties I owe

Obedience first and latest 

For Justice wills it so.
