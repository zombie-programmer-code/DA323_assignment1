Total independence,

Glorious song of the people,

Total independence,

1. 
Warriors in the war without weapons,

Live flame in the soul of the people,

Congregating the sons of the islands

Around the Immortal Fatherland.



Total independence, total and complete,

Building, in progress and peace,

With the heroic hands of the people,

The happiest nation on earth.

Total independence,

Glorious song of the people,

Total independence,

Sacred hymn of combat.




2. 
Working, struggling, struggling and conquering,

We go ahead with giant steps

In the crusade of the African peoples,

Raising the national flag.



Voice of the people, present, present and united,

Strong beat in the heart of hope

To be a hero in the hour of peril,

A hero of the Nation’s resurgence.




CHORUS:

Total independence,

Glorious song of the people,

Total independence,

Sacred hymn of combat.

Dynamism

In the national struggle,

Eternal oath

To the sovereign country of São Tomé and Príncipe.
