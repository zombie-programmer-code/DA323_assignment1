People of Africa!

The historic past!

Sing the hymn of a Guinea proud and young

Illustrious epic of our brothers

Who died on the field of honour while liberating Africa!

The people of Guinea, preaching Unity,

Call to Africa.

Liberty! The voice of a people

Who call all her brothers to find their way again.

Liberty! The voice of a people

Who call all her brothers of a great Africa.

Let us build African Unity in a newly found independence!
