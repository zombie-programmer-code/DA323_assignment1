O dear country, O Belgiumâ€™s soil,

To you our hearts, our hands to you,

To you our blood, O native land,

We swear to you, O fatherland!

So gladly bloom in beauty full,

Into what freedom has taught you to be,

And evermore shall sing your sons:

To Law and King and Freedom, hail!

And evermore shall sing your sons:

To Law and King and Freedom, hail!

To Law and King and Freedom, hail!

To Law and King and Freedom, hail!
