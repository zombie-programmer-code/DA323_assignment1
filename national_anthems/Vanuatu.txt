CHORUS:

We, we, we are happy to proclaim

We, we, we are the people of Vanuatu




1. 
God has given us this land,

We have great cause for rejoicing

We are strong and we are free in this land

We are all brothers




Chorus




2. 
There were many ways before

There are many ways today

But we are all one

Despite our many ways




Chorus




3. 
We work hard 

On our many islands

God helps us in our work

He is Our Father!




Chorus
