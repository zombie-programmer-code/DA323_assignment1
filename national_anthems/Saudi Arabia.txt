Hasten to glory and supremacy!

Glorify the Creator of the heavens

And raise the green, fluttering flag,

Carrying the emblem of Light!

Repeat â€“ God is greatest!

O my country,

My country, may you always live,

The glory of all Muslims!

Long live the King,

For the flag and the country!
