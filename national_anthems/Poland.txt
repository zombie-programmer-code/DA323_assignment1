1. 
Poland has not yet perished.
 

As long as we live, 

What foreign violence has seized, 

With sabres in hand we will retrieve. 




CHORUS:


March! March, Dabrowski! 

From Italy to Poland!
 

Under your command 

Unite us as a people. 




2. 
Cross the Vistula and Warta 

We shall be Poles; 

Bonaparte has shown us 

The way to victory. 




Chorus




3. 
Like Czarniecki to Poznan, 

After the war with the Swede,

To save our country,

We shall return by sea. 




Chorus




4. 
A father, in tears, 

says to his Basia: 

“Just listen, it seems that our people 

are beating the drums.”




Chorus
