O Lord, protect for us our Majesty the Sultan

And the people in our land,

With honour and peace.

May he live long, strong and supported,

Glorified be his leadership.

For him we shall lay down our lives.

O Oman, since the time of the Prophet

We are a dedicated people amongst the noblest Arabs.

So ascend to the apex of the heavens 

illuminate the cosmos 

Rejoice and relish in prosperity
