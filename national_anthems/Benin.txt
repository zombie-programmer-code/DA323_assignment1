CHORUS:

Children of Benin, arise!

The resounding cry of freedom

Is heard at the first light of dawn;

Children of Benin, arise!




1. 
Formerly, at her call, our ancestors

Knew how to engage in mighty battles

With strength, courage, ardour, and full of joy, but at the price of blood.

Builders of the present, you too, join forces

Each day for the task stronger in unity.

Build without ceasing for posterity.




Chorus




2. 
When all around there blows a wind of anger and hate:

Citizen of Benin, be proud, and in a calm spirit

Trusting in the future, behold your flag!

In the green you read hope of spring;

The red signifies the courage of your ancestors;

The yellow foretells the richest treasures.




Chorus




3. 
Beloved Benin, your sunny mountains, palm trees, and green pastures

Show everywhere your brightness;

Your soil offers everyone the richest fruits.

Benin, from henceforth your sons are united

With one brotherly spirit sharing the hope of seeing you

Enjoy abundance and happiness for ever.




Chorus
