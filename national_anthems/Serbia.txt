1. 
God of Justice; Thou who saved us

when in deepest bondage cast,

Hear Thy Serbian childrenâ€™s voices,

Be our help as in the past.



With Thy mighty hand sustain us,

Still our rugged pathway trace;

God, our hope; protect and cherish

Serbian country and Serbian race!

God, our hope; protect and cherish

Serbian country and Serbian race!




2. 
Bind in closest links our kindred

Teach the love that will not fail,

May the loathed fiend of discord

Never in our ranks prevail.



Let the golden fruits of union

Our young tree of freedom grace;

God, our Master! guide and prosper

Serbian country and Serbian race.

God, our Master! guide and prosper

Serbian country and Serbian race.




3. 
Lord! Avert from us Thy vengeance,

Thunder of Thy dreaded ire;

Bless each Serbian town and hamlet,

Mountain, meadow, heart and spire.



When our host goes forth to battle

Death or victory to embrace-

God of armies! be our leader

Strengthen then the Serbian race.

God of armies! be our leader

Strengthen then the Serbian race.




4. 
On our sepulchre of ages

Breaks the resurrection morn,

From the slough of direst slavery

Serbia anew is born.



Through five hundred years of durance

We have knelt before Thy face,

All our kin, O God! deliver,

Thus entreats the Serbian race. 

All our kin, O God! deliver,

Thus entreats the Serbian race.
