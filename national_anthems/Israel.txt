As long as deep in the heart,

The soul of a Jew yearns,

And towards the East

An eye looks to Zion,




CHORUS:

Our hope is not yet lost,

The hope of two thousand years,

To be a free people in our land,

The land of Zion and Jerusalem.

To be a free people in our land,

The land of Zion and Jerusalem.
