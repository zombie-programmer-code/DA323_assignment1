For all time the Lao people have glorified their Fatherland,

United in heart, spirit and vigour as one.

Resolutely and increasing the dignity of the Lao people

And proclaiming the right to be their own masters.

The Lao people of all origins are equal

And will no longer allow imperialists and traitors to harm them.

The entire people will safeguard the independence

And the freedom of the Lao nation.

They are resolved to struggle for victory

In order to lead the nation to prosperity.
