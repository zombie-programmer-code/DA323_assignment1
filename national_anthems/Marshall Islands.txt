My island lies o’er the ocean;

Like a wreath of flowers upon the sea;

With a light of Mekar from far above;

Shining with the brilliance of rays of life;.

Our Father’s wondrous creation;

Bequeathed to us, our Motherland;

I’ll never leave my dear home sweet home;

God of our forefathers protect and bless forever Marshall Islands.
