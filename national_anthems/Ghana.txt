1. 
God bless our homeland Ghana

And make our nation great and strong,

Bold to defend forever

The cause of Freedom and of Right;

Fill our hearts with true humility,

Make us cherish fearless honesty,

And help us to resist oppressors’ rule

With all our will and might evermore. 

And help us to resist oppressors’ rule

With all our will and might evermore.




2. 
Hail to thy name, O Ghana,

To thee we make our solemn vow:

Steadfast to build together

A nation strong in Unity;

With our gifts of mind and strength of arm,

Whether night or day, in the midst of storm,

In ev’ry need, whate’er the call may be,

To serve thee, Ghana, now and evermore.

In ev’ry need, whate’er the call may be,

To serve thee, Ghana, now and evermore.




3. 
Raise high the flag of Ghana

And one with Africa advance;

Black star of hope and honor

To all who thirst for liberty;

Where the banner of Ghana free flies,

May the way to freedom truly lie;

Arise, arise, O sons of Ghanaland,

And under God march on for evermore!

Arise, arise, O sons of Ghanaland,

And under God march on for evermore!
