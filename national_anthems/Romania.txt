1. 
Wake up, Romanian, from your deadly sleep

Into which you’ve been sunk by the barbaric tyrants

Now, or never, your fate renew,

To which your enemies will bow to.




2. 
Now or never let’s give proof to the world

That in these veins still flows a Roman blood,

That in our chests we still maintain our pride in a name

The victor in his battles, the name of 
Trajan!




4. 
Watch on, shadows of highnesses, Mihai, Stefan, Corvinus,

The Romanian Nation, your great grandchildren,

With weapons in their arms, with your fire in their veins,

“Life in freedom or death!” shout all.




11. 
Priests, lead with your crucifixes! Because our army is Christian,

The motto is Liberty and its goal is holy,

Better to die in battle, in full glory,

Than to once again be slaves upon our ancient ground!
