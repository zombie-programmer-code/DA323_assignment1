CHORUS:

Your flag is a splendour of sky

Crossed with a band of snow;

And there can be seen, in its sacred depths,

Five pale blue stars.

In your emblem, which a rough sea

With its wild waves protects,

Behind the bare summit of a volcano,

A star brightly shines.




Chorus




1. 
Like an Indian maiden you have been sleeping,

Lulled by the resonant song of your seas,

When, set in your golden valleys,

The bold navigator found you;

And on seeing, enraptured, your beauty,

And feeling your enchantment,

He dedicated a kiss of love to the blue hem

of your splendid mantle.




Chorus




2. 
From a country where the sun rises,

Beyond the blue Atlantic,

That man who had dreamt you

In search of you he launched to sea.

When you raised your pale forehead,

In the lively anxiousness of your hope,

Under the gentle dome of your sky

Already floated a strange banner.




Chorus




3. 
It was useless that your beloved Indian

Rushed into the fight with ire,

Because, covered with his blood, Lempira,

In the deep night he sank;

And of the heroic deed, in memory,

The legend alone has kept

A sepulcher in a forgotten place,

And the severe profile of a mountain peak.




Chorus




4. 
For three centuries your children heard

The imperious mandate of the master;

For three centuries your useless complaint

In the blue atmosphere was lost

But one glorious day your ear

Perceived, powerful and distant,

That there, far away, over the Atlantic,

Indignantly, a lion roared




Chorus




5. 
It was France, the free, the heroic,

Which in its dreams of centuries slept,

Awoke irate to life

At the virile protest of Danton:

It was France, who sent to the death

The head of the consecrated King,

And which built up proudly at its side,

The altar of the goddess of Reason.




Chorus




6. 
You also, oh my country!, arose

From your servile deep sleep;

You also showed the world

The infamous shackle destroyed.

And in your blessed soil, behind the tall

Hair of the wild jungle,

Like a bird of black feathers,

The fleeting colony was lost.




Chorus




7. 
To guard this sacred emblem

We shall march, oh fatherland, to our death;

Our death will be honoured

If we die thinking of your love.

Having defended your holy flag,

And shrouded in its glorious folds,

Many, Honduras, shall die for you,

But shall fall in honour.




Chorus
