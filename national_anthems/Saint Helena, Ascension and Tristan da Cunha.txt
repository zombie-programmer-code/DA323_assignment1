1. 
My heart is drifting southward

To my home down in the sea

It’s the isle of St. Helena

Where my loved ones wait for me

Long since I left it

But I’ll soon be going home

To my St. Helena island

And swear I’ll never roam




2. 
Diamonds they are pretty

So is your fancy cars

But St. Helena island

Is prettier by far

All the wonders of this world

I’m told they number seven

But St. Helena Island

Is the nearest one to heaven




3. 
Diamonds they are pretty

So is your fancy cars

But St. Helena island

Is prettier by far

Someday if the Lord above

Comes out of heaven’s gate

I’m sure He’ll pick St. Helena

And use it as His place
