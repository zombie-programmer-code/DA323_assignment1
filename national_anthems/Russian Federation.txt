1. 
Russia – our sacred stronghold,

Russia – our beloved country.

A mighty will, a great glory

Are your heritage for all times!




CHORUS:

Be glorious, our free Motherland,

Ancient union of brotherly peoples,

Ancestor given wisdom of the people!

Be glorious, country! We take pride in you!




2. 
From the southern seas to the polar region

Spread our forests and our fields.

You are one in the world! You are one of a kind,

Native land protected by God!




Chorus




3. 
A broad expanse for dreams and for lives

Is opened to us by the coming years.

Our faith in our Motherland gives us strength.

So it was, so it is, and so it will always be!




Chorus
