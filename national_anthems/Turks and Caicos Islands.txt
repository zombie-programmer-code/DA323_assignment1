1. 
Oh we salute this land of ours

Our country we declare

This promised land 

With its beauties grand

Though small it is our own




CHORUS
:

Turks and Caicos, Turks and Caicos

Our country firm and free

Our allegiance, Turks and Caicos

We pledge and we affirm.




2. 
From the east, west, north and south

Our banks and oceans meet

Surrounding sands and hills of glee

Our pristine beauties see




Chorus




3. 
Our people forged and blend

With multiplicity

Of race and kind and creed and tongue

United by our goals




Chorus




4. 
We stand with courage brave

To maintain this land of ours

With islands scattered here and there

With trust in God we stand.




Chorus
