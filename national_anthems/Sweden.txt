1. 
Thou ancient, thou free and mountainous North

Thou quiet, thou joyful beauty!

I greet thee, most beautiful land upon earth,

Thy sun, Thy sky and meadows green.

Thy sun, Thy sky and meadows green.




2. 
Thou rest upon memories of great olden days,

When honored thy name flew across the world,

I know that thou art and will be as thou were,

Yes, I want to live I want to die in the North

Yes, I want to live I want to die in the North
