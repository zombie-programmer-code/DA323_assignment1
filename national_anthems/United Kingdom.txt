1. 
God save our gracious King,

Long live our noble King,

God save the King:

Send him victorious,

Happy and glorious,

Long to reign over us:

God save the King.




2. 
O Lord, our God, arise,

Scatter his enemies,

And make them fall.

Confound their politics,

Frustrate their knavish tricks,

On Thee our hopes we fix,

God save us all.




3. 
Thy choicest gifts in store,

On him be pleased to pour;

Long may he reign:

May he defend our laws,

And ever give us cause


With  heart and voice to sing

God save the King
