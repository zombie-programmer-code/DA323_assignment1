1. 
Sun, sweat, verdure and sea,

Centuries of pain and hope;

This is the land of our ancestors.

Fruit of our hands,

Of the flower of our blood:

This is our beloved country.




CHORUS:

Long live our glorious country!

The banner of our struggle

Has fluttered in the skies.

Forward, against the foreign yoke!

We are going to build

Peace and progress

In our immortal country!

Peace and progress

In our immortal country!




2. 
Branches of the same trunk,

Eyes in the same light;

This is the force of our unity!

The sea and the land,

The dawn and the sun are singing

That our struggle has borne fruit!




Chorus
