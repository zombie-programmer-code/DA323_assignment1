Fountain of Freedom

Source of Light

Where sovereignty and safety meet,

Safety and sovereignty may you ever combine!

You have lived among nations

With title sublime,

Filling each heart,

Sung by each tongue,

Your champion has risen

And answered your call.

For your soul and your body,

The victory they have conquered.

In my mouth and in my blood

Your breezes have stirred both light and fire.

Up! my brethren,

Strive for the highest.

We call to the world

That we are here ready.

We salute as our emblem

God, Homeland, and King.
