1. 
“Tuvalu for the Almighty”

Are the words we hold most dear;

For as people or as leaders

Of Tuvalu we all share

In the knowledge that God

Ever rules in heav’n above,

And that we in this land

Are united in His love.

We build on a sure foundation

When we trust in God’s great law;

“Tuvalu for the Almighty”

Be our song for evermore!




2. 
Let us trust our lives henceforward

To the King to whom we pray,

With our eyes fixed firmly on Him

He is showing us the way.

“May we reign with Him in glory”

Be our song for evermore,

for His almighty power

Is our strength from shore to shore.

Shout aloud in jubilation

To the King Whom we adore.

“Tuvalu free and united”

Be our song for evermore!
