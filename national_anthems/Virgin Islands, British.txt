1. 
Out of the huts of historyâ€™s pain

Our ancestors bled and died

But with strength and will power we overcame

To restore Virgin Islands pride!

To preserve your beauty we devised a plan

To retain ownership of your precious lands!

Educating your people is the golden key

To maintain the success of this Territory!




CHORUS:

Oh how radiant are your daughters!

And how wealthy are your sons!

Your beaches boast your beauty!

And your success is second to none!

Green and brilliant are your hillsides!

They replenish our hopes and pride!

Oh 
Beautiful
 Virgin Islands!

Your qualities can never be denied!




2. 
May God richly bless this Territory!

May we ask three things of thee,

Courage for our great leaders

That they may rule our destiny!

We ask for wisdom for our people

That we may live in harmony!

And understanding for our children

So they may cherish this legacy!




Chorus
