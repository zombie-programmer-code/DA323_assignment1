1. 
Bolivians, a most favorable destiny

has at long last crowned our vows and longings;

This land is free, free at last.

Its servile state has now finally ceased.

The martial turmoil of yesterday,

and the horrible clamor of war,

are followed today, in harmonious contrast,

by sweet hymns of peace and unity.

Are followed today, in harmonious contrast,

by sweet hymns of peace and unity.




CHORUS:
  
Let us keep the lofty name of our country

in glorious splendor.

And, on its altars, once more we must swear:

to die before we would live as slaves.

To die before we would live as slaves.

To die before we would live as slaves.




2. 
Eternal praise to the brave warriors

whose heroic valor and firmness

conquered the freedom and glories that now

a happy Bolivia justly begins to enjoy!

Let their names, preserved forever in marble and bronze,

transmit their glory to remote future ages.

And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:

Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

And in resounding song let them repeat their simple call:

Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!


Chorus




3. 
Here has Justice erected its Throne

which vile oppression ignores

and, on its glorious stamp let us rejoice

Freedom, freedom, freedom

This innocent and beautiful land,

which owes its name to Bolívar,

is the happy homeland where mankind

enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.

Is the happy homeland where mankind

enjoys the benefits of good fortune and peace.


Chorus




4. 
If a foreigner may, any given day

even attempt to subjugate Bolivia,

let him prepare for a fatal destiny,

which menaces such brave aggressor.

For the sons of the mighty Bolívar

have sworn, thousands upon thousands of times,

to die rather than see the country’s

majestic banner humiliated.

To die rather than see the country’s

majestic banner humiliated.


Chorus
