O sons of the Sahara! In the battlefield, you are torch holders in the long road

Make revolution in our nation and follow this path for her sake.

Cut off the head of the invader. Cut off the head of the invader.

O revolutionaries, the homeland will be glorious. Cut off the estates in this region.

Remove in war the causes for protest and abandon it; no submission, no yielding.

No agent, no invader, no agent, no invader.

You who ask about us: we are the ones who drive the transforming struggle.

We are the ones who smash that idol, we are the ones who understand the beautiful lesson.

We are the people of the path; we are the people of the path.

We are the ones who revealed the path against the raid, the one that burns up the raiders.

It is the war to erase the oppressor and establish the right of the laborers.

We are the people of the path; We are the people of the path.

The uprising is for the people and will advance in the Arab lands.

It will produce unity forever in the hearts and will establish justice and democracy.

Every century, every generation, every century, every generation.
