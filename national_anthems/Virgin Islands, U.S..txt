1. 
All hail our Virgin Islands.

Em’ralds of the sea,

Where beaches bright with coral sand 

And trade winds bless our native land.

All hail our Virgin Islands,

Bathed in waters blue,

We give our loyalty, 

Full to thee,

And pledge allegiance forever true.




2. 
To thee our Virgin Islands,

Loving voices raise

A song in praise of brotherhood,

Where right makes might to fight for good.

To thee our Virgin Islands,

Haven of the free,

We sing our love to thee, 

Joyously, 

Our own fair islands of liberty.




3. 
March on oh Virgin Islands, 

In the joyful throng,

Uphold the right and right the wrong 

Where only peace and love belong.

March on oh Virgin Islands,

Democratic land.

Together hand in hand, 

Take your stand, 

Forever soldiers in freedom’s band.




4. 
God bless our Virgin Islands,

Humbly now we pray,

Where all mankind can join today 

In friendly warmth of work and play.

God bless our Virgin Islands, 

Beautiful and tall.

Beneath a sunny sky, 

Hilltops high 

Hold out a welcome for one and all.
