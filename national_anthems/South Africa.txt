God Bless Africa

Raise high Her glory

Hear our Prayers

God bless us, we her children



God protect our nation

End all wars and tribulations

Protect us, protect our nation

Our nation South Africa â€“ South Africa



From the blue of our heaven

From the depths of our sea,

Over our eternal mountain ranges

Where the cliffs give answer



Sounds the call to come together,

And united we shall stand,

Let us live and strive for freedom,

In South Africa our land.
