Lift up your head to the rising sun, Bahamaland;

March on to glory, your bright banners waving high.

See how the world marks the manner of your bearing!

Pledge to excel through love and unity.

Pressing onward, march together to a common loftier goal;

Steady sunward, though the weather hide the wide and treacherous shoal.

Lift up your head to the rising sun, Bahamaland;

Till the road youâ€™ve trod Lead unto your God, March on, Bahamaland!
