CHORUS:  

Every nation has its own flag. 

Every nation has its own flag. 

Ours is like the sky without any signs of clouds

All of which we have come to love.




1. 
Oh you White Star, at your service we are

Oh you White Star, at your service we are

Superior you are, in any part of our land

Be famous oh Star, like the sun




Chorus




2. 
On the day you arose, our hearts you have

On the day you arose, our hearts you have

Purified with pureness 

O Allah, do not dim the flag, pray we in this night




Chorus
