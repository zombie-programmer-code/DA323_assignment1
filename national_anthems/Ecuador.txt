CHORUS
:

O homeland, we greet you a thousand times!

Glory be to you, O homeland, glory be to you!

Your breast overflows with joy and peace,

And we see your radiant face shining

More brightly than the sun.




2. 
The worthy sons of the soil

Which Pichincha on high is adorning,

Always acclaimed you as sovereign lady

And shed their blood for you.

God observed and accepted the sacrifice,

And that blood was the prolific seed

Of other heroes whom the world in astonishment saw

Arising in thousands around you.


Chorus




3. 
For these steel armed heroes  
 
Nothing in the land was invincible  
 
And from the valley to the high Sierra  
 
Could the clamour of the struggle be heard;  

After the struggle, victory came flying.  
 
And freedom followed on victoryâ€™s heel.  
 
And the toppled lion could be heard,  
 
As it roared in impotence and vanity.  


Chorus
