Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!

O Great Land, your children are heroes.

We are ready to be martyred for you.

We are ready to shed blood for you.

Three-coloured flag, flourish honourably!

Three-coloured flag, flourish honourably!

Thousands of lives have been sacrificed.

Your bosom has become a battlefield.

Every devoted soldier

Has become a hero.

You are prospering.

My life is always dedicated to you.

My love for you is embedded in my heart

A thousand and one times.

To preserve everything

And to honour her flag

All the youth are willing.

Great Land! Great Land!

Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!

Azerbaijan! Azerbaijan!
