1. 
Fortunate Guatemala! May your altars

Never be profaned by cruel men.

May there never be slaves who submit to their yoke,

Or tyrants who deride you.

If tomorrow your sacred soil

Should be threatened by foreign invasion,

Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,

Will call to you: Conquer or die.




CHORUS:

Your fair flag, flying freely in the wind,

Will call to you: Conquer or die;

For your people, with heart and soul,

Would prefer death to slavery.




2. 
From your old and hard chains  

You forged, with an ire-driven hand,  

The plow that fertilizes the soil  

And the sword that saves honor.  



Our fathers fought one day,  

Lit up in patriotic burning  

And they were able, without bloody clash,  

To place you on a throne of love.  




CHORUS:

And they were able, without bloody clash,  

To place you on a throne of love,  

That our Nation, in energetic assent,
  
Gave life to the ideal redeemer. 




3. 
Your emblem shows a piece of the sky  

In which a cloud gets its whiteness  

Wretched is he who dares in madness  

stain your colors  



Well, your brave and proud sons  

who admire the peace within  

will never avoid the rough battles  

if they are to defend their land and their home.  




CHORUS:
 

They will never avoid the rough battles  

if they are to defend their land and their home  

that honor is the idea that reigns their souls  

and the altar of the mother country their altar 




4. 
Lying in the magnificent Andes  

with two oceans at hearing distance  

under the wing of seeds and gold  

you become entranced from the beautiful quetzal  



Native bird that lives in your seal  

protector that protects your soil  

hopefully he will fly high  

more than the condor and the royal eagle!  




CHORUS:
 

Hopefully he will fly high  

more than the condor and the royal eagle  

and in his wings, raise up to the sky:  

Guatemala, your immortal name!
