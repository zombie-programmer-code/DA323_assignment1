1. 
Stand tall, my free country, good fortune and salvation to you,

You yourself a companion to friends, Oh! Loving one!

Flourish, Oh! Creator of eternal knowledge and science,

May your fame for ever shine bright!




CHORUS:

These valleys are golden – my dear Uzbekistan,

Our forefathers’ manly spirits your companion!

Strenght of great people in turbulent times

Made this land the world’s joy!




2. 
Oh! Generous Uzbek, your faith will not fade,

Free, young generations are your mighty wings!

The torch of independence, guardians of peace,

Oh! Worthy motherland, flourish and prosper eternally!




Chorus
