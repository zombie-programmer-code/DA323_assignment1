CHORUS:

Repeat, Oh World, my song.  

Echo it over and over again.  

Remember, through my joy, each martyr.  

Clothe him with the shining mantles Of our festival.



Repeat, Oh World, my song.

Repeat, Oh World, my song.




1. 
Oh my country, we are sons and grandsons of your men.

We will guard all of your majesty in our hands.

Its light will be immortal on all ways

Every rock on your mountains, all atoms of your soils




2. 
All wets of your waters, are our mine.

There are for our large wishes, and our right.

Came from your pastâ€™s pretty glories.




Chorus




3. 
My unity, Oh marvellous song fill myself

You are promise in our response

My banner, Oh cloth nailed from every sun

Raise forever on every peak

My nation, give me strength, Oh source of strength

And save me for you, best nation




4. 
In faith and love I am part of mankind.

An Arab I am in all my life.

My heart beats in tune with Yemen.

No foreigner shall dominate over Yemen.




Chorus
