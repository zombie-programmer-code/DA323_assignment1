1. 
Where over the world, say where,

You find an island there,

So lovely small with nations free

With people French and Dutch

Though talking English much,

As thee Saint Martin in the sea?




CHORUS:

O sweet Saint Martin’s Land

So bright by beach and strand

With sailors on the sea and harbors free

Where the chains of mountains green

Variously in sunshine sheen



Oh I love thy Paradise,

Nature beauty fairly nice

Oh I love thy Paradise,

Nature beauty fairly nice




2. 
How pretty between all green

Flamboyants beaming gleam

Of flowers red by sunlight set

Thy cows and sheep and goats

In meadows or on the roads

Thy donkeys keen I can’t forget




Chorus




3. 
Thy useful birds in white

Their morn and evening flight

Like aircrafts-wings in unity

Their coming down for food

Then turning back to roost

Bring home to me their harmony




Chorus




4. 
Saint Martin I like thy name

In which Columbus fame

And memories of old are closed

For me a great delight

Thy Southern Cross the night

May God the Lord protect thy coast!




Chorus
