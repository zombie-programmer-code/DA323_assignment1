1. 
For three centuries a reign oppressed

The unhappy peoples of America,

But one day, their anger aroused, they said:

“An end to this!” and broke the reign.

Our forefathers, fighting magnificently,

Displayed their martial glory,

And when the august diadem was shattered,

They raised the triumphal cap of liberty.




CHORUS:

Paraguayans, Republic or death!

It was our strength that gave us our final liberty.

Neither tyrants nor slaves can continue,

Where unity and equality reign,

Where unity and equality reign.




2. 
A new Rome, the Fatherland shall proudly display

Two leaders of name and valor

Who, rivals, like Romulus and Remus

Divided government and power.

Long years, during which Phoebus in the clouds

Saw darken the pearl of the South,

Today a grand hero appears

Raising up again her glory and virtue…




Chorus




3. 
Europe and the world salute her with applause

And also acclaim

Invincible bastion of heroism,

Magnificent Eden of riches.

(But) when discord rumbled all around

Which fatally devoured other Peoples,

Paraguayans, the sacred ground

Was covered by an angel with its wings.




Chorus




4. 
Oh, how pure, of laurel girded

Sweet Fatherland, in this manner you show yourself.

In your ensign one sees the colors

Of sapphire, diamond, and ruby.

In your coat of arms, which the Sun illuminates,

Under the cap, one sees the lion.

Double image of the strong and the free,

And of glories, the memory and crest.




Chorus




5. 
From the tomb of vile feudalism

The national Deity rises free;

Oppressors, bend your knees!

Compatriots, entone the hymn!

Sound the cry, “Republic or death”!

Our breasts exhale it with faith,

And the mountains repeat its echoes

Like giants arising.




Chorus




6. 
Our Fatherland defends liberty and justice;

Tyrants: listen!

The laws in its sacred charter

Will sustain its heroism in the fight.

Against the world, if the world opposes it,

If the world dares to insult her security,

Battling to avenge we shall know her

Or die embracing her.




Chorus




7. 
Arise, oh People, your splendid sword

That strikes with sparkles of God,

There is no middle ground between free or slave

And an abyss divides the two.

In the gentle breezes the Hymn resounds,

Repeating with triumphal echo:

For the free, renowned glory!

For the Fatherland, immortal laurel!




Chorus
