CHORUS:

Fatherland, fatherland, East Timor our Nation

Glory to the people and to the heroes of our liberation



Fatherland, fatherland, East Timor our Nation

Glory to the people and to the heroes of our liberation




1. 
We vanquish colonialism, 

We cry: down with imperialism!

Free land, free people, 

No, no, no to exploitation.



Let us go forward, united, firm and determined

In the struggle against imperialism, 

The enemy of people,

Until final victory, 

Onward to revolution.
