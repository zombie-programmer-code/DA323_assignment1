1. 
My homeland, My homeland

Glory and beauty, Sublimity and splendor

Are in your hills, Are in your hills

Life and deliverance, Pleasure and hope

Are in your air, Are in your Air

Will I see you? Will I see you?

Safe and comforted, Sound and honored

Safe and comforted, Sound and honored

Will I see you in your eminence?

Reaching to the stars, Reaching to the stars

My homeland, My homeland 




2. 
My homeland, My homeland

The youth will not tire, â€™till your independence, or they die

We will drink from death and will not be to our enemies like slaves, like slaves

We do not want, We do not want

An eternal humiliation nor a miserable life

An eternal humiliation nor a miserable life

We do not want

But we will bring back our storied glory, our storied glory

My homeland, My homeland 




3. 
My homeland, My homeland 

The sword and the pen, not the talk nor the quarrel

Are our symbols, Are our symbols

Our glory and our covenant and a duty to be faithful

Moves us, moves us

Our glory, Our glory

Is an honorable cause and a waving standard

Is an honorable cause and a waving standard

O, behold you in your eminence

Victorious over your enemies, victorious over your enemies

My homeland, My homeland
