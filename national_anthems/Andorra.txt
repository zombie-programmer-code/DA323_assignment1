The great Charlemagne, my Father, liberated me from the Saracens,

And from heaven he gave me life of Meritxell the great Mother.

I was born a Princess, a Maiden neutral between two nations.

I am the only remaining daughter of the Carolingian empire

Believing and free for eleven centuries, believing and free I will be.

The laws of the land be my tutors, and my defender Princes!

And Princes my defender!
