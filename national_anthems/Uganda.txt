1. 
Oh Uganda! may God uphold thee,

We lay our future in thy hand.

United, free,

For liberty

Together we’ll always stand.




2. 
Oh Uganda! the land of freedom.

Our love and labour we give,

And with neighbours all

At our country’s call

In peace and friendship we’ll live.




3. 
Oh Uganda! the land that feeds us

By sun and fertile soil grown.

For our own dear land,

We’ll always stand,

The Pearl of Africa’s Crown.
