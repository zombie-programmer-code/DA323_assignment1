1. 
O lift high the banner, the flag of Zimbabwe,

The symbol of freedom proclaiming victory;

We praise our heroesâ€™ sacrifice,

And vow to keep our land from foes;

And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.




2. 
O lovely Zimbabwe, so wondrously adorned

With mountains, and rivers cascading, flowing free;

May rain abound, and fertile fields;

May we be fed, our labour blessed;

And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.




3. 
O God, we beseech Thee to bless our native land;

The land of our fathers bestowed upon us all;

From Zambezi to Limpopo

May leaders be exemplary;

And may the Almighty protect and bless our land.
