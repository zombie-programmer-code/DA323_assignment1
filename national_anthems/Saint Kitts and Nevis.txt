1. 
O Land of Beauty!

Our country where peace abounds,

Thy children stand free

On the strength of will and love.

With God in all our struggles,

Saint Kitts and Nevis be

A Nation bound together

With a common destiny.




2. 
As stalwarts we stand,

For justice and liberty,

With wisdom and truth

We will serve and honour thee.

No sword nor spear can conquer,

For God will sure defend.

His blessings shall for ever

To posterity extend.
