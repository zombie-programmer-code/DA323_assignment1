1. 
Let us show pride and honour our nation

Where righteous people reside

Where prosperity and fellowship may persevere

Abandon deeds that are immoral




CHORUS: 



Let Fiji live on

And progress onwards

May our leaders be honourable men

Let them lead our people

To great things

And bring an end to all things immoral




2. 
The burden of change lie on your shoulders youth of Fiji

Be the strength to cleanse our nation

Be wary and not harbour malice

For we must abandon such sentiments forever




Chorus
