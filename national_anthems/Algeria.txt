1. 
We swear by the lightning that destroys,

By the streams of generous blood being shed,

By the bright flags that wave,

Flying proudly on the high djebels,

That we are in revolt, whether to live or to die,

We are determined that Algeria should live,

So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!




2. 
We are soldiers in revolt for truth

And we have fought for our independence.

When we spoke, nobody listened to us,

So we have taken the noise of gunpowder as our rhythm

And the sound of machine guns as our melody,

We are determined that Algeria should live,

So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!




3. 
O France, the time of reproof is over

And we have ended it as a book is ended;

O France, this is the day of reckoning

So prepare to receive from us our answer!

In our revolution is the end of empty talk;

We are determined that Algeria should live,

So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!




4. 
From our heroes we shall make an army come to being,

From our dead we shall build up a glory,

Our spirits shall ascend to immortality

And on our shoulders we shall raise the Standard.

To the nationâ€™s Liberation Front we have sworn an oath,

We are determined that Algeria should live,

So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!




5. 
The cry of the Fatherland sounds from the battlefields.

Listen to it and answer the call!

Let it be written with the blood of martyrs

And be read to future generations.

Oh, Glory, we have held out our hand to you,

We are determined that Algeria should live,

So be our witness -be our witness -be our witness!
