CHORUS
:

Mexicans, at the cry of war,

Grasp the steel and the bridle,

And let the earth’s core tremble

To the roar of the cannon.




1. 
O Homeland! may your brow be wreathed with the olive

By the divine archangel of Peace

For in heaven, your eternal destiny

Has been written by the finger of God.



But if a foreign enemy should dare

To profane your ground with his step,

Think, o beloved Homeland! that heaven

Gave you a soldier in each son.




Chorus




5. 
War, war without truce upon him who means

To sully the blazon of the Homeland;

War, war! Soak our homeland’s flags

In the waves of blood.



War, war! In the mountains and the valley,

The dreadful cannons thunder,

And the deafening echoes resound

The cries of Union! Liberty!




Chorus




6. 
O Homeland, before your unarmed sons

Bend their necks under the yoke,

Your countrysides will be watered with blood

And in blood will be their footprints.



And your temples, palaces, and towers

Will fall with terrible thunder,

And their ruins shall live to say,

“This was the fatherland of a thousand heroes.”




Chorus




10. 
Homeland, Homeland! Your sons swear

To breathe out their breath on your altars,

If the clarion with its warlike tone

Calls them to struggle with valour.



For you the garlands of olive!

For them a memory of glory!

For you a laurel of victory!

For them a tomb of honour!




Chorus
