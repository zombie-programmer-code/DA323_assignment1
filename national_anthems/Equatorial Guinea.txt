We walk along the path

Of our immense joy.

In brotherhood, without division,

We sing Liberty!

After two centuries of being subdued

Under colonial domination,

In fraternal union, without discrimination,

We sing Liberty!

We cry, long live a free Guinea,

And we defend our liberty 

We always sing, free Guinea,

And we always preserve our unity.

We cry, long live a free Guinea,

And we defend our liberty

We always sing, free Guinea,

And we preserve and we preserve our national independence

And we preserve and we preserve our national independence.
