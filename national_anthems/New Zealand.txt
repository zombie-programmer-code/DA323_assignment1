1. 
O Lord, God, 

Of all people

Listen to us, 

Cherish us

May good flourish, 

May your blessings flow

Defend 
Aotearoa




2. 
Let all people, 

Red skin, white skin

Māori, Pākehā

Gather before you

May all our wrongs, we pray,

Be forgiven

So that we might say long live

Aotearoa




3. 
May it be forever prestigious,

May it go from strength to strength,

May its fam spread far and wide,

Let not strife

Nor dissention ensue,

May it ever be great

Aotearoa




4. 
Let its territory

Be ever enlightened

Throughout the land

Let envy and dissension

Be dispelled,

Let peace reign

Over Aotearoa




5. 
Let its good features endure,

Let righteousness and honesty

Prevail

Among the people of God

Let it never be ashamed,

But rather, let its name be known

Thereby becoming the model to emulate

Aotearoa
