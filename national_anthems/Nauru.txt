Nauru our homeland, the land we dearly love,

We all pray for you and we also praise your name.

Since long ago you have been the home of our great forefathers

And will be for generations yet to come.

We all join in together to honour your flag,

And we shall rejoice together and say;

Nauru for evermore!
