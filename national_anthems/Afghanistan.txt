1. 
This land is Afghanistan

It is pride of every Afghan

The land of peace, the land of sword

Its sons are all braves




2. 
This is the country of every tribe

Land of Baloochs, and Uzbeks

Pashtoons, and Hazaras

Turkman and Tajiks




3. 
With them, Arabs and Gojars

Pamirian, Nooristanian

Barahawi, and Qizilbash

Also Aimaq, and Pashaye




4. 
This Land will shine for ever

Like the sun in the blue sky

In the chest of Asia

It will remain as heart for ever




5. 
We will follow the one God

We all say, Allah is great,

we all say, Allah is great,

we all say, Allah is great
