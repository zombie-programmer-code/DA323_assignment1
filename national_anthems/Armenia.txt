1. 
Land of our fathers, free, independent,

Which has endured from age to age.

Its sons and daughters now proclaim

Armenia, sovereign and free.

Its sons and daughters now proclaim

Armenia, sovereign and free.




2. 
Brother, take this banner,

Made with my own hands,

During sleepless nights,

And bathed in my tears.

During sleepless nights,

And bathed in my tears.




3. 
See, it has three colours;

A single hallowed symbol.

May it sparkle before the foe,

May Armenia flourish ever!

May it sparkle before the foe,

May Armenia flourish ever!




4. 
Death is everywhere the same,

Man is born just once to die,

But blest is he who gives his life

To defend his nation’s freedom.

But blest is he who gives his life

To defend his nation’s freedom.
