1. 
We from Pitcairn Island. We welcome you today

We’re glad you come to see us  but soon you’ll sail away

We hope you will remember, The love we try to show

The friendships we have made today remains though you must go




CHORUS
:

We will miss you as you journey on your way

We do wish that you with us could ever stay

But we know that God will keep us in his hands

Perhaps one day we’ll meet again on this far distant strand




2. 
Our Island is so tiny encircle by the sea

Its shoreline is so rugged as you so well can see

Yet we so dearly love it our homes are also there

And if you come our way again our welcome you may share




Chorus
