1. 
Heroes of the sea, noble race,

Valiant and immortal nation,

Now is the hour to raise up on high once more

Portugal’s splendour.

From out of the mists of memory,

Oh Homeland, we hear the voices

Of your great forefathers

That shall lead you on to victory!




CHORUS:

To arms, to arms

On land and sea!

To arms, to arms

To fight for our Homeland!

To march against the enemy guns!




2. 
Unfurl the unconquerable flag

In the bright light of your sky!

Cry out all Europe and the whole world

That Portugal has not perished.

Your happy land is kissed

By the Ocean that murmurs with love.

And your conquering arm

Has given new worlds to the world!




Chorus




3. 
Salute the Sun that rises

On a smiling future:

Let the echo of an insult be

The signal for our revival.

The rays of that powerful dawn

Are like a mother’s kisses

That protect us and support us

Against the insults of fate.




Chorus
