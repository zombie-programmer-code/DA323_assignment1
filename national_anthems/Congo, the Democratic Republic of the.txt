CHOIR:

Arise, Congolese, united by fate,

United in the struggle for independence,

Let us hold up our heads, so long bowed,

And now, for good, let us keep moving boldly ahead, in peace.

Oh, ardent people, by hard work we shall build,

In peace, a country more beautiful than before.




VERSE:

Countrymen, sing the sacred hymn of your solidarity,

Proudly salute the golden emblem of your soverignity, Congo.




REFRAIN:

Blessed gift 
Congo
 of our forefathers 
Congo
,

Oh country 
Congo
 that we love 
Congo
,

We shall people your soil and ensure your greatness.


30th June
 Oh gentle sun 
30th June
 of 30th June,


Sacred day
 Be witness 
sacred day
 of the immortal oath of freedom

That we hand on to our children for ever.
