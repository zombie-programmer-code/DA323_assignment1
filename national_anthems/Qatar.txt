CHORUS:

Swearing by God who erected the sky

Swearing by God who spread the light

Qatar will always be free

Sublimed by the souls of the sinceres




1. 
Procede thou on the manners of the ascendants

And advance on Prophetâ€™s guidance

In my heart,

Qatar is an epic of glory and dignity

Qatar is land of the early men

Who protect us at time of distress,

Doves they can be at times of peace,

Warriors they are at times of sacrifice




Chorus
