The flag is flying,

Announcing complete independence;

The nation rises up

Because of the faith we have

In this our Comoria.

Let us always have devotion

To love our Great Islands.



We Comorians are of one blood,

We Comorians are of one faith.

On these Islands we were born,

These Islands brought us up.

May God always help us;

Let us always have the firm resolve

To love our fatherland,

Love our religion and the world.



The flag is flying.

From the Sixth of July

The Nation rises up;

Our Islands are lined up.

Maori and Anzuan, 

Moheli and Comore,

Let us always have devotion

To love our Great Islands.
