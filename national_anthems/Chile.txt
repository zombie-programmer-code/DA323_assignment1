Chile, your sky is a pure blue,

Pure breezes blow across you,

And your field, embroidered with flowers,

Is a happy copy of Eden.

Majestic is the snow-covered mountain

That was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,

That was given to you by the Lord as a bastion,

And the sea that tranquilly washes your shore

Promises future splendour for you,

And the sea that tranquilly washes your shore

Promises future splendour for you.




CHORUS
:

Sweet fatherland, accept the vows

With which Chile swore at your altars:

Either you’ll be the tomb of the free

Or the refuge against oppression

Either you’ll be the tomb of the free

Or the refuge against oppression

Either you’ll be the tomb of the free

Or the refuge against oppression

Or the refuge against oppression

Or the refuge against oppression.
