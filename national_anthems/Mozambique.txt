1. 
In the memory of Africa and the World

Beautiful fatherland of that they had dared to fight

Mozambique, your name is Freedom

The Sun of June forever will shine




CHORUS:

Mozambique, our Glorious Land

Rock by rock constructing the new day

Millions of arms in one only force

O Loved fatherland we go to be successful



Mozambique, our Glorious Land

Rock by rock constructing the new day

Millions of arms in one only force

O Loved fatherland we go to be successful




2. 
Joined people from Rovuma to Maputo

It harvests the fruits of the combat for the Peace

The dream grows waving in the flag

It goes cultivating in the certainty of tomorrow




Chorus




3. 
Flowers sprouting of the soil of your sweat

For mounts, the rivers, the sea

We swear for you, O Mozambique

No tyrant in will go them to enslave




Chorus
