CHORUS:

My country, my country

My country, oh my land, oh land of my forefathers

Warrior, warrior

Warrior, oh my people, Oh people of eternity




1. 
By my strong will and my inflaming rage, my volcanic revenge

By my yearning blood for my land and home

I have climbed the mountains and combated struggles

I have subdued in the impossible and smashed the shackles




Chorus




2. 
By the storming winds and the firing arms

By my people determination, by the land of strife

Palestine is my home, Palestine is my fire

Palestine is my revenge, and the land of resistance




Chorus




3. 
By vowing the oath beneath the shade of the flag

By my land, by my people, by my firing pain

Resistor I must survive, freedom fighter I must proceed

Sacrificer I must end, until I return




Chorus
