We salute you, O land of hope,

Country of hospitality;

Thy gallant legions

Have restored thy dignity.



Beloved Ivory Coast, thy sons,

Proud builders of thy greatness,

All mustered together for thy glory,

In joy will construct thee.



Proud citizens of the Ivory Coast, the country calls us.

If we have brought back liberty peacefully,

It will be our duty to be an example

Of the hope promised to humanity,

Forging unitedly in new faith

The Fatherland of true brotherhood.
