Where prevail justice and independence

(It’s our country … our land)

Where prevail equal rights and correct policies

For people to lead a peaceful life

(It’s our country … our land)

We solemnly pledge to preserve

Union, the heritage, for perpetuity

(‘Til the end of the world, Myanmar!,

Since she is the true inheritance from our forefathers, we love and value her.)

We will fight and give our lives for the union

This is the country and land of our own

For her prosperity, we will responsibly shoulder the task,

Standing as one in duty to our precious land.
