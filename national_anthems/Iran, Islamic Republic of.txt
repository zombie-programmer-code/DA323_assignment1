Upwards on the horizon rises the Eastern Sun,

The light in the eyes of those who believe in 
the right
.

Bahman â€“ the brilliance of our Faith.

Your message, O Imam, of independence and freedom

is imprinted on our souls.

O Martyrs! Your cries echo in the ears of history.

Enduring, continuing, eternal,

The Islamic Republic of Iran.
