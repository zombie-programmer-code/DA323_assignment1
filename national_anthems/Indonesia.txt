Indonesia, my native land

The land where I shed my blood

There, I stand

To be the guard of my motherland



Indonesia, my nationality

My nation and my homeland

Let us exclaim

“Indonesia unites!”



Long live my land, long live my state

My nation, my people, entirely

Build its soul, build its body

For the Great Indonesia




CHORUS:

Great Indonesia, independent & sovereign!

My land, my country which I love

Great Indonesia, independent & sovereign!

Long live Great Indonesia!



Great Indonesia, independent & sovereign!

My land, my country which I love

Great Indonesia, independent & sovereign!

Long live Great Indonesia!
