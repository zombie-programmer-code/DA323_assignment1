1. 
Arise children of the fatherland

The day of glory has arrived

Against us tyranny’s

Bloody standard is raised

The bloody standard is raised

Listen to the sound in the fields

The howling of these fearsome soldiers

They are coming into our midst

To cut the throats of your sons and consorts




CHORUS:

To arms citizens

Form you battalions

March, march

Let impure blood

Water our furrows




2. 
What do they want this horde of slaves

Of traitors and conspiratorial kings?

For whom these vile chains

These long-prepared irons?

These long-prepared irons?

Frenchmen, for us, ah! What outrage

What methods must be taken?

It is we they dare plan

To return to the old slavery!




Chorus




3. 
What! These foreign cohorts!

They would make laws in our courts!

What! These mercenary phalanxes

Would cut down our warrior sons

Cut down our warrior sons

Good Lord! By chained hands

Our brow would yield under the yoke

The vile despots would have themselves be

The masters of destiny




Chorus




4. 
Tremble, tyrants and traitors

The shame of all good men

Tremble! Your parricidal schemes

Will receive their just reward

Will receive their just reward

Against you we are all soldiers

If they fall, our young heros

France will bear new ones

Ready to join the fight against you




Chorus




5. 
Frenchmen, as magnanimous warriors

Bear or hold back your blows

Spare these sad victims

Who with regret are taking up arms against us

With regret are taking up arms against us

But not these bloody despots

These accomplices of Bouillé

All these tigers who pitilessly

Are ripping open their mothers’ breasts




Chorus




6. 
Sacred Love for the Fatherland

Lead and support our avenging arms

Liberty, cherished liberty

Join the struggle with your defenders

Join the struggle with your defenders

Under our flags, let victory

Hasten to you virile force

So that in death your enemies

See your triumph and our glory!




Chorus




7. 
We shall enter into the pit

When our elders will no longer be there

There we shall find their ashes

And the mark of their virtues

And the mark of their virtues

We are much less jealous of surviving them

Than of sharing their coffins

We shall have the sublime pride

Of avenging or joining them




Chorus
