1. 
â€˜Tis here we are pledging,

with heart and with hand,

Full measure of devotion

to thee, our native land,

Full measure of devotion

to thee, our native land.




2. 
Now all join the chorus, 

let union abide.

Across all Micronesia

join hands on every side,

Across all Micronesia

join hands on every side.




3. 
We all work together, 

with hearts, voice and hand,

Till we have made these islands

another promised land,

Till we have made these islands

another promised land.
