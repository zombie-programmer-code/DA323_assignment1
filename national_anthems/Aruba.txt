1. 
Aruba beloved home

our venerated cradle

though small and simple you may be

you are indeed esteemed.




CHORUS
:

Aruba our dear country

our rock so well beloved

our love for you is so strong

that nothing can destroy it. 

that nothing can destroy it. 




2. 
Your beaches so much admired

with palm trees all adorned

your coat of arms and flag

the symbols of our pride.




Chorus




3. 
The greatness of our people

is their great cordiality

and may God guide and preserve

its love for freedom.
