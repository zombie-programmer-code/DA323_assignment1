CHORUS
:

O unfading glory!

O immortal joy!

In furrows of pain

goodness germinates now 

goodness germinates now. 

O unfading glory!

O immortal joy!

In furrows of pain

goodness germinates now.




1. 
The horrible night has ceased,

the sublime liberty

spills the auroras

of its invincible light.

All humanity,

moans within its chains,

understands the words

of He who died on the Cross.




Chorus




2. 
“Independence!” cries

the American world;

soaked in blood of heroes

the land of Columbus.

Still, one great principle,

“The king is not sovereign”,

resounds, and those who suffer

bless their passion.




Chorus




3. 
The Orinoco’s bed

fills with the remains,

of blood and tears a river

is there seen flowing.

In Bárbula they don’t know

the souls nor the eyes,

if admiration or horror

feel or suffer.




Chorus




4. 
On the shores of the Caribbean,

famished, the people fight,

horrors preferring

to treacherous health.

O, aye! for Cartagena

the abnegation is much,

and the shambles of death

its courage despises.




Chorus




5. 
From Boyacá in the fields,

the genius of glory,

for every ear a hero

undefeated crowned.

Soldiers without breastplate

won victory;

their virile breath

as shield served.




Chorus




6. 
Bolivar crosses the Andes

that two oceans bathe,

swords as sparks

shine in Junín.

Untameable centaurs

descend to the plains,

and a prescience begins to be felt,

of the epic the end.




Chorus




7. 
The victorious trumpet

in Ayacucho thunders,

that in every triumph grows

its formidable sound.

In its expansive thrust

Liberty is worn for the first time,

from the American sky

a pavilion forming.




Chorus




8. 
The virgin her hairs

pulls out in agony

and from her beloved widowed

hangs them on a cypress.

Regretting her hope

covered by a cold headstone,

but glorious pride

hallows her fair skin.




Chorus




9. 
Thus the motherland is formed,

Thermopylaes are breaking forth;

constellation of cyclops

its night brightened.

The trembling flower

finding the wind mortal,

underneath the laurels

safety sought.




Chorus




10. 
But it’s not complete glory

to defeat in battle,

that the arm that fights

is encouraged by truth.

Independence alone

The great clamour doesn’t silence;

if the sun illuminates everyone,

justice is liberty.




Chorus




11. 
From men the rights

Nariño’s preaching,

the soul of struggle

prophetically taught.

Ricaurte in San Mateo,

in atoms flying,

“Duty before life,”

with flames he wrote.




Chorus
