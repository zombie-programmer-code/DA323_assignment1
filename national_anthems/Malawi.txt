1. 
O God bless our land of Malawi,

Keep it a land of peace.

Put down each and every enemy,

Hunger, disease, envy.

Join together all our hearts as one,

That we be free from fear.

Bless our leader,

each and every one,

And Mother Malawi.




2. 
Our own Malawi, this land so fair,

Fertile and brave and free.

With its lakes, refreshing mountain air,

How greatly blest are we.

Hills and valleys, soil so rich and rare

Give us a bounty free.

Wood and forest, plains so broad and fair,

All â€“ beauteous Malawi.




3. 
Freedom ever, let us all unite

To build up Malawi.

With our love, our zeal and loyalty,

Bringing our best to her.

In time of war, or in time of peace,

One purpose and one goal.

Men and women serving selflessly

In building Malawi.
