1. 
O arise all you sons of this land,

Let us sing of our joy to be free,

Praising God and rejoicing to be

Papua New Guinea.




CHORUS
:

Shout our name from the mountains to seas

Papua New Guinea;

Let us raise our voices and proclaim

Papua New Guinea.




2. 
Now give thanks to the good Lord above

For His kindness, His wisdom and love

For this land of our fathers so free,

Papua New Guinea.




CHORUS
:

Shout again for the whole world to hear

Papua New Guinea;

We’re independent and we’re free,

Papua New Guinea.
