1. 
Hail to thee, land of our forefathers,

Thou who made them strong, peaceful and happy,

Cultivating virtue and bravery

For posterity.

Even if tyrants shall come, thy heart yearns towards freedom.

Togo arise! Let us struggle without faltering.

Victory or death, but dignity.

God almighty, Thou alone we exalt

You have made Togo prosper.

People of Togo arise! Let us build the nation.




2. 
To serve thee in unity 

That is the most burning desire of our hearts. 

Let us shout aloud our motto 

That nothing can tarnish. 

We the only builders of thy happiness and of thy future, 

Everywhere let us break chains and treachery, 

And we swear to thee for ever faith, 

And love, service, untiring zeal, 

To make thee yet, 

Beloved Togo, a golden example for humanity. 




3. 
Hail, hail to the entire Universe

Let us unite our efforts on this immense building site

Whence will be reborn anew

Great Humanity.

Everywhere, instead of misery, let us bring happiness.

Let us chase from the world unruly hatred.

Itâ€™s over with slavery and Captivity.

At the star of liberty,

Let us renew the solidarity

Of the Nations in fraternity.
