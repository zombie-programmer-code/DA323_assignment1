CHORUS:

Kuwait, Kuwait, Kuwait,

My country,

In peace live, in dignity,

Your face bright,

Your face bright,

Your face bright with majesty,

Kuwait, Kuwait, Kuwait,

My country.




1. 
Oh cradle of ancestry,

Who put down its memory,

With everlasting symmetry,

Showing all eternity,

Those Arabs were Heavenly,

Kuwait, Kuwait, Kuwait,

My country.




Chorus




2. 
Blessed be

My country,

A homeland for harmony,

Warded by true sentry,

Giving their souls aptly,

Building high its history,

Kuwait, Kuwait, Kuwait,

My country.




Chorus




3. 
Weâ€™re for you, My country,

Led by faith and loyalty,

With its Prince equally,

Fencing us all fairly,

With warm love and verity,

Kuwait, Kuwait, Kuwait,

My country,

In peace live, in dignity.




Chorus
