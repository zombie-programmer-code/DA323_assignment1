PRELUDE:

Eritrea, Eritrea, Eritrea,

Her enemy decimated,

and her sacrifices vindicated by liberation.




1. 
Steadfast in her goal,

symbolizing endurance,

Eritrea, the pride of her oppressed people,

proved that the truth prevails.




CHORUS:

Eritrea, Eritrea,

holds her rightful place in the world.




2. 
Dedication that led to liberation,

Will build up and make her green,

We shall honor her with progress,

We have a word to her to embellish.




Chorus
