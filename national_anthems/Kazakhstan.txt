1. 
Sky of golden sun,

Steppe of golden seed,

Legend of courage –

Take a look at my country!



From antiquity

Our heroic glory emerged,

They did not give up their pride

My Kazakh people are strong!




CHORUS
:

My country, my country,

As your flower I will be planted,

As your song I will stream, my country!

My native land  – My Kazakhstan!




2. 
The way was opened to posterity

I have a vast land.

Its unity is proper,

I have an independent country.



It welcomed the time

Like an eternal friend,

Our country is happy,

Such is our country.




Chorus
