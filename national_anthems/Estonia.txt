1. 
My fatherland, my joy and happiness,

How beautiful you are!

I shall not find such ever

In this huge wide world

Which would be so dear to me

As you, my fatherland!




2. 
You have given me birth

And raised me up;

I shall thank you always

And remain faithful to you â€™til death,

To me most beloved are you,

My precious fatherland!




3. 
May God watch over you,

My precious fatherland!

Let Him be your defender

And provide bountiful blessings

For whatever you undertake,

My precious fatherland!
