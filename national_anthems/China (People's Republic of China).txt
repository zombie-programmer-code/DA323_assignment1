Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!

With our flesh and blood, let us build our new Great Wall!

The Chinese nation faces its greatest danger.

From each one the urgent call for action comes forth.

Arise! Arise! Arise!

Millions with but one heart,

Braving the enemy’s fire.

March on!

Braving the enemy’s fire.

March on! March on! March on!
