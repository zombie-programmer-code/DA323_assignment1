1. 
Our country, whoâ€™s become so old 

your head all covered with white hair. 

Always held us, your children, 

in your bosom providing the riches of your coasts. 




2. 
As middle children in the family 

we blossomed here Greenland, 

we want to call ourselves before your proud 

and honourable head. 




3. 
With a burning desire to develop 

what you have to give, renewing, 

Removing your obstacles our desire 

to move is forward, forward. 




4. 
The way of matured societies 

is our zealous goal to attain; 

the effect of speech and letters 

we long to behold. 




5. 
Humbleness is not the course 

Greenland wake up and be proud! 

A dignified life is our goal; 

couragously take a stand.
