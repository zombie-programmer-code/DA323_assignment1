1. 
Land of mountains, land on the River,

Land of fields, land of spires,

Land of hammers, with a rich future,


Home of great daughters and sons
,

A nation blessed by its sense of beauty,

Highly praised Austria, highly praised Austria.




2. 
Strongly fought for, fiercely contested,

You are in the centre of the Continent

Like a strong heart,

You have born since the earliest days

The burden of a high mission

Much tried Austria, much tried Austria.




3. 
Watch us striding free and believing,

With courage, into new eras,

Working cheerfully and full of hope,

In 
jubilant chorus
 let us take in unity

The oath of allegiance to you, our country,

Our much beloved Austria, our much beloved Austria.
