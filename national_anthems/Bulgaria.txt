Proud Balkan mountains,

next to them the Danube flows,

the sun sheds its light over Thrace,

shining over Pirin. 




CHORUS:
Dear native land,

you are paradise on earth,

your beauty and your charm,

ah, they never end. 



Dear native land,

you are paradise on earth,

your beauty and your charm,

ah, they never end.
