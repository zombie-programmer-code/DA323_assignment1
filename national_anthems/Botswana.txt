1. 
Blessèd be this noble land,
  
Gift to us from God’s strong hand,
  
Heritage our fathers left to us.
  
May it always be at peace.




CHORUS:
  
Awake, awake, O men, awake!
  
And women close beside them stand,
  
Together we’ll work and serve
  
This land, this happy land!




2. 
Word of beauty and of fame,
  
The name Botswana to us came.
  
Through our unity and harmony,
  
We’ll remain at peace as one.


Chorus
