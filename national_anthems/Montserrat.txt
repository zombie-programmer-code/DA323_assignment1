1. 
Oh Montserrat, proud Motherland

Your children raise your standard high.

In toil and tears to serve you well

The emerald jewel from Godâ€™s hand




CHORUS:

Oh Montserrat, by nature blest

To you your children sing

Come well or woe, come friend or foe

To you your people cling




2. 
Rise up and make our country great

With art and skill and sacrifice

With masque and drum we celebrate

Triumphant masters of our fate




Chorus




3. 
We sing our land in harmony

May God be her eternal guard

And make Montserrat a house of hope,

A haven in the Carib Sea.




Chorus




4. 
No pestilence shall mar your shore

No fount of sadness overwhelm

A people striving under God

Their spirits free forevermore




Chorus
