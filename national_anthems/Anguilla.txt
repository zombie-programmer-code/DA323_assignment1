1. 
God bless Anguilla

Nurture and keep her

Noble and beauteous

She stands midst the sea

Oh land of the happy

A haven we’ll make thee

Our lives and love

We give unto thee




CHORUS
:

With heart and soul

We’ll build a nation

Proud, strong and free

We’ll love her hold her

Dear to our hearts for eternity

Let truth and right

our banner be

We’ll march ever on




2. 
Mighty we’ll make her

Long may she prosper

God grant her leaders

wisdom and grace

May glory and honour

Ever attend her

Firm shall she stand

Throughout every age




Chorus
