Oh! Central Africa, cradle of the Bantu!

Take up again your right to respect, to life!

Long subjugated, long scorned by all,

But, from today, breaking tyrannyâ€™s hold.

Through work, order and dignity

You reconquer your rights, your unity,

And to take this new step

The voice of our ancestors call us.




CHORUS:
  
To work! In order and dignity,

in the respect for rights and in unity,

Breaking poverty and tyranny,

Holding high the flag of the Fatherland.
