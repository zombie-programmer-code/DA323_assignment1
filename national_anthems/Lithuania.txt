Lithuania, our homeland,

Land of worshiped heroes!

Let your sons draw their strength

From our past experience.



Let your children always follow

Only roads of virtue,

May your own, mankindâ€™s well-being

Be the goals they work for.



May the sun above our land

Bannish darkening clouds around

Light and truth all along

Guide our steps forever.



May the love of Lithuania

Brightly burn in our hearts.

For the sake this land

Let unity blossom.
