The land of Borinquen, 

where I was born, 

is a flower-garden 

of magical brilliance.



An ever-clear sky 

is its canopy, 

and the waves sing lullabies 

at its feet.



When Columbus reached these beaches, 

full of awe he exclaimed, 

“Oh! this is the lovely land 

that I seek.”



Borinquen is the daughter 

of the sea and the sun.

the sea and the sun.

the sea and the sun.

the sea and the sun.

the sea and the sun.
