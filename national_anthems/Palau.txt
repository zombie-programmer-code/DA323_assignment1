1. 
Palau is coming forth with strength and power

By her old ways abides still every hour

One country, safe, secure, one government

Under the glowing floating soft light stands




2. 
Let’s build our economy’s protecting fence

With courage, faithfulness and diligence

Our life is anchored in Palau, our land

We with our might through life and death defend




3. 
In spirit let’s join hands, united, one

Care for our homeland…from forefathers on

Look after its concord, its glory keep

Through peace and love and heart’s devotion deep




4. 
God bless our country, our island home always

Our sweet inheritance from ancient days

Give us strength and power and all the rights

To govern with to all eternity
