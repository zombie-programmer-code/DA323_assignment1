In the middle of the sea

Is where my home is

That is where I will spend my days

It is my desire

If I ever leave this place

One day I will return

For I can never leave you

O land of mine




CHORUS:

A thousand times and more

I will honor and salute you

Beautiful islands of the Marianas

Glory be to you
