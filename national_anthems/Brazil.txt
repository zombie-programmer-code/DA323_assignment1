1. 
The Ypiranga’s placid banks heard 

The resounding shouting of a heroic people.

And the sun of freedom, in bright rays,

Shone at this moment in the homeland’s skies.

As the promise of this equality

Was secured by our strong arms,

In your bosom, O Freedom,

We are ready to die.



O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!

Brazil, a vivid dream, a lively ray

Of love and hope settles on the earth,

As in your beautiful sky, smiling and limpid,

The image of the Southern Cross shines resplendent.

A giant by nature, you are beautiful,

Strong, an intrepid colossus,

And your future mirrors this grandeur.




CHORUS:
  
O land we adore, among a thousand others

You are the beloved one.

You are the gentle mother of the sons of this land,

Beloved homeland, Brazil!




2. 
Eternally laid in a splendid cradle,

To the sound of the sea and the light from the depths of the sky,

Brazil, you gleam, fleuron of the Americas,

Illuminated by the sun of the New World.

Your smiling, lovely fields have more flowers

Than the most attractive land elsewhere,

Our forests have more life,

Our life in your bosom more love.



O beloved, idolized homeland, hail, hail!

Brazil, may you have as eternal symbol

The starry banner you display,

And may the green laurel of this pennant speak

Of peace in the future and glory in the past.

But if you raise a strong cudgel in the name of justice,

You will see that a son of yours does not run from a fight,

Nor does one who adores you fear death.


Chorus
