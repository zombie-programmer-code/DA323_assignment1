Hail to thee, Nicaragua.  In your land

The cannonâ€™s voice no longer roars,

Nor does the blood of our brothers

Stain your glorious bicoloured flag.

Nor does the blood of our brothers

Stain your glorious bicoloured flag.



Peace shines in beauty in your skies,

Nothing dims your immortal glory,

For work is what earns your laurels

And honour is your triumphal ensign,

Is your triumphal ensign.
