1. 
Defenders of the realm,

Peace on you;

Our proud spirits will

Not be subdued.

The abode of Arabism,

A hallowed sanctuary;

The seat of the stars,

An inviolable preserve.




2. 
Syriaâ€™s plains are

Towers in the heights,

Resembling the sky

Above the clouds.

A land resplendant

With brilliant suns,

Becoming another sky,

Or almost a sky.
