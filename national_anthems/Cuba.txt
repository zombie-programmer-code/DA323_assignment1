Hasten to battle, men of Bayamo,

For the homeland looks proudly to you.

You do not fear a glorious death,

Because to die for the country is to live.



To live in chains is to live 

in dishonour and ignominy.

Hear the clarion call,

Hasten, braves ones, to battle!

To live in chains is to live 

in dishonour and ignominy.

Hear the clarion call,

Hasten, braves ones, to battle!
