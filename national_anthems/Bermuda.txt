1. 
Hail to Bermuda

My island in the sun

Sing out in glory

To the nation we’ve become

We’ve grown from heart to heart

And strength to strength

This privilege is mine

To sing long live Bermuda

Because this island’s mine




2. 
Hail to Bermuda

My homeland dear to me

This is my own land

Built on strength and unity

We’ve grown from heart to heart

And strength to strength

For loyalty is prime

And sing long live Bermuda

Because this island’s mine!
