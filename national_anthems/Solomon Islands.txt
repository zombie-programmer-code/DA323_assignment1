God save our Solomon Islands from shore to shore.

Bless all her people and her Lands

With Your protecting hands.

Joy, Peace, Progress and Prosperity;

That men should brothers be, make nations see.

Our Solomon Islands, Our Solomon Islands,

Our Nation, Solomon Islands,

Stands for evermore.
