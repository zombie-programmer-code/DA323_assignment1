Hear, mortals, the sacred cry:

“Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!”

Hear the noise of broken chains,

see the noble Equality enthroned.

Their most honorable throne have opened

the United Provinces of the South.

And the free ones of the world reply:

“To the Argentine people, cheers!”

“To the Argentine people, cheers!”

And the free ones of the world reply:

“To the Argentine people, cheers!”

And the free ones of the world reply:

“To the Argentine people, cheers!”




CHORUS
:

May the laurels be eternal

the ones we managed to win,

the ones we managed to win.

Let us live crowned in glory…

or let us swear in glory to die!

Or let us swear in glory to die!

Or let us swear in glory to die!
