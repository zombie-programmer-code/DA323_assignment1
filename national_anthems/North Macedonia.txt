1. 
Today over Macedonia

A new sun of freedom rises,

Macedonians fight

For their rights.

For their rights.

Now once again flies

The flag of the 
Krusevo Republic
,


Goce Delcev, Pitu Guli,

Dame Gruev, Sandanski

The Macedonian woodlands sing brightly

New songs, new awakenings.

Free Macedonia

Lives free.

Free Macedonia

Lives free.
