1. 
Lesotho, land of our Fathers,

You are the most beautiful country of all.

You give us birth,

In you we are reared

And you are dear to us.




2. 
Lord, we ask You to protect Lesotho.

Keep us free from conflict and tribulations.

Oh, land of mine,

Land of our Fathers,

May you have peace.
