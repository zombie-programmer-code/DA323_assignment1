1. 
God be with our Suriname

And elevate our lovely land

However we came together here

We are dedicated to his land

Working we keep in mind

justice and truth make free

All thatâ€™s good we should do

That gives value to our land 




2. 
Rise country men, rise

The soil of Suriname is calling you.

Where ever our ancestors came from

We should take care of our country.

We are not afraid to fight

God is our leader

Our whole life until our death,

We will fight for Suriname.
