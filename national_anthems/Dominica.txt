1. 
Isle of beauty, isle of splendor,

Isle to all so sweet and fair,

All must surely gaze in wonder

At thy gifts so rich and rare.

Rivers, valleys, hills and mountains,

All these gifts we do extol.

Healthy land, so like all fountains,

Giving cheer that warms the soul.




2. 
Dominica, God hath blest thee

With a clime benign and bright,

Pastures green and flowers of beauty

Filling all with pure delight,

And a people strong and healthy,

Full of godly, rev’rent fear.

May we ever seek to praise Thee

For these gifts so rich and rare.




3. 
Come ye forward, sons and daughters

Of this gem beyond compare.

Strive for honour, sons and daughters,

Do the right, be firm, be fair.

Toil with hearts and hands and voices.

We must prosper! Sound the call,

In which ev’ryone rejoices,

“All for Each and Each for All.”
