1. 
Heaven protects our King

And gives him happiness and glory

To reign over our souls and our destinies,

The one being, heir of the Sovereign builders,

Guiding the proud old Kingdom.




2. 
Temples are asleep in the forest,

Remembering the splendour of Moha Nokor.

Like a rock the Khmer race is eternal.

Let us trust in the fate of Cambodia,

The empire which challenges the ages.




3. 
Songs rise up from the pagodas

To the glory of holy Buddhist faith.

Let us be faithful to our ancestorsâ€™ belief.

Thus heaven will lavish its bounty

Towards the ancient Khmer country, the Moha Nokor.
