I shall always recognise you

By the dreadful sword you hold,

As the earth, with searching vision,

You survey, with spirit bold.



â€˜Twas the Greeks of old whose dying

Brought to birth our spirit free.

Now, with ancient valour rising,

Let us hail you, oh Liberty!

Now, with ancient valour rising,

Let us hail you, oh Liberty!

Now, with ancient valour rising,

Let us hail you, oh Liberty!
