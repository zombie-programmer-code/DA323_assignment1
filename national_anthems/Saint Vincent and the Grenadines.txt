1. 
Saint Vincent! Land so beautiful,

With joyful hearts we pledge to thee

Our loyalty and love, and vow

To keep you ever free. 




CHORUS
:

Whateâ€™er the future brings,

Our faith will see us through.

May peace reign from shore to shore,

And God bless and keep us true.




2. 
Hairoun!
 Our fair and blessed Isle,

Your mountains high, so clear and green,

Are home to me, though I may stray,

A haven, calm, serene.




Chorus




3. 
Our little sister islands are

Those gems, the lovely Grenadines,

Upon their seas and golden sands

The sunshine ever beams.




Chorus
