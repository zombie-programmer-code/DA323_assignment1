Oh God!

We praise and glorify you

For your grace on South Sudan

The land of great abundance 

Uphold us united in peace and harmony



Oh motherland!

Arise! Raise your flag with the guiding star

And sing songs of freedom with joy

For peace, justice and liberty

Shall forever more reign



Oh great warriors!

Let us stand up in silence and respect

Saluting our martyrs whose blood

Cemented our national foundation

We vow to protect our nation



So Lord, bless South Sudan!
