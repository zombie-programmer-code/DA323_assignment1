Samoa arise

And raise your banner that is your crown.

Samoa arise

And raise your banner that is your crown.

Oh! See and behold the stars on the waving banner;


They are a sign that Samoa is able to lead
.

Samoa hold fast your freedom forever.


Do not be afraid; neâ€™er again your crown shall be taken
;

Our treasured precious liberty.

Samoa arise

And wave your banner that is your crown.
