1. 
Our land, our land, our fatherland,

Sound loud, O name of worth!

No mount that meets the heaven’s band.

No hidden vale, no wavewashed strand.

Is loved, as is our native North. 

Our own forefathers’ earth.

No mount that meets the heaven’s band.

No hidden vale, no wavewashed strand.

Is loved, as is our native North. 

Our own forefathers’ earth.




11. 
Thy blossom, in the bud laid low,

Yet ripened shall upspring.

See! From our love once more shall grow

Thy light, thy joy, thy hope, thy glow!

And clearer yet one day shall ring 

The song our land shall sing.

See! From our love once more shall grow

Thy light, thy joy, thy hope, thy glow!

And clearer yet one day shall ring 

The song our land shall sing.
