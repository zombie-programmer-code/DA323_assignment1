Noble homeland, your beautiful flag

Express for us your life:

Under the limpid blue of your skies,

Peace reigns, white and pure.



In the tenacious battle of fruitful toil,

That brings a glow to menâ€™s faces,

Your sons, simple farm hands,

Gained eternal renown, esteem and honour 

Gained eternal renown, esteem and honour.



Hail gentle country, hail loving mother!

If anyone should attempt to besmirch your glory,

You will see your people, valiant and virile,

Exchange their rustic tools for weapons.



Hail O homeland! Your prodigal soil

Gives us sweet sustenance and shelter.

Under the limpid blue of your sky,

May peaceful labour ever continue.
