From the shores of the Niger to the edges of the Ténéré

Brothers and sisters we are

Children of a same fatherland Niger

Fed of the sap of the same ideals

For a Niger of peace, free, strong, and united

For a prosperous Niger, the country of our dreams

For the honor of the fatherland

Let us incarnate the valiance and the perseverance

And all the virtues of our worthy forefathers

Intrepid, determined and proud warriors

Let us defend the homeland at the price of our blood

Let us make Niger the symbol of dignity

The emblem and torch of Africa advancing

For these noble ideals, arise and go forward

Forward for work and forward for the fight

We remain standing

Holding high the flag of our dear country

In the sky of Africa and in the whole universe

To construct together

A world of justice, peace and progress

And to make Niger the pride of Africa
