This island of our ancestors

To live in peace and joy

Hey! We are truly blessed.

The body and heart, spirit that is ours,

You are precious and truly deserving.

Oh our beloved fatherland!

We wish that you will be blessed,

So that the Creator of this world

Will be the foundation of your laws.
