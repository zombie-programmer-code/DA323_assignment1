1. 
Soldiers of Vietnam, we go forward,

With the one will to save our Fatherland,

Our hurried steps are sounding on the long and arduous road.

Our flag, red with the blood of victory, bears the spirit of our country.

The distant rumbling of the guns passes over the bodies of our foes.

Overcoming all hardships, together we build our resistance bases.

Ceaselessly for the people’s cause let us struggle,

Let us hasten to the battle-field!

Forward! All together advancing!

Our Vietnam is strong, eternal.

Soldiers of Vietnam, we go forward!

The gold star of our flag in the wind

Leading our people, our native land, out of misery and suffering.

Let us join our efforts in the fight for the building of a new life.

Let us stand up and break our chains

For too long have we swallowed our hatred.

Let us keep ready for all sacrifices and our life will be radiant.

Ceaselessly for the people’s cause let us struggle,

Let us hasten to the battle-field!

Forward! All together advancing!

Our Vietnam is strong, eternal.
