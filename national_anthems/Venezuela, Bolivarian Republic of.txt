CHORUS:

Glory to the brave nation 

Which shook off the yoke,

Respecting law, 

Virtue and honour. 

Glory to the brave nation 

Which shook off the yoke,

Respecting law, 

Virtue and honour. 




1. 
“Off with the chains! Off with the chains!” 

Cried the Lord, cried the Lord, 

And the poor man in his hovel 

Implored freedom.

At this holy name, 

there trembled

The vile selfishness 

that had triumphed,

At this holy name, At this holy name, 

there trembled

The vile selfishness 

that had triumphed,

The vile selfishness 

that had triumphed,




Chorus




2. 
Let’s cry out aloud, Let’s cry out aloud:

Down with oppression! Down with oppression!

Faithful countrymen, your strength

Lies in your unity;

And from the heavens

The supreme Creator

Breathed a sublime spirit

Into the nation.

And from the heavens And from the heavens

The supreme Creator

Breathed a sublime spirit

Into the nation.

Breathed a sublime spirit

Into the nation.




Chorus




3. 
United by bonds United by bonds

Made by heaven, Made by heaven,

All America exists

As a Nation;

And if tyranny

Raises its voice,

Follow the example

Given by Caracas.

And if tyranny And if tyranny

Raises its voice,

Follow the example

Given by Caracas.

Follow the example

Given by Caracas.
