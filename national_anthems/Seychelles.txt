Seychelles, our homeland.

Where we live in harmony.

Joy, love and peace,

We thank God.

Let us preserve the beauty of our country

And the wealth of our oceans,

Which are both precious heritages

For the future of our children.

Let us stay in unity always

Under the colours of our new flag,

And toghether for eternity

Seychellois, Unite!
