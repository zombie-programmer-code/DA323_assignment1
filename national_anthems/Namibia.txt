Namibia land of the brave

Freedomâ€™s fight we have won

Glory to their bravery

Whose blood waters our freedom 

We give our love and loyalty

Together in unity

Contrasting beautiful Namibia

Namibia our country 

Beloved land of savannahs

Hold high the banner of liberty 




CHORUS
:

Namibia our country

Namibia motherland

We love thee.
