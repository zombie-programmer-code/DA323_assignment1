CHORUS:

Let us salute the motherland,

Proud to be called her children.

To her well-being let us swear

Boldly and unceasingly to devote our lives.

Let us salute the motherland,

Proud to be called her children.

To her well-being let us swear

Boldly and unceasingly to devote our lives,

our lives,

our lives,

our lives,

our lives.




1. 
Of peace enjoyed in perfect happiness,

El Salvador has always nobly dreamed.

To achieve this has been her eternal proposition,

To keep it, her greatest glory.

With inviolable faith, she eagerly follows

The way of progress

In order to fulfil her high destiny

And achieve a happy future.

A stern barrier protects her

Against the clash of vile disloyalty,

Ever since the day when her lofty banner,

In letters of blood, wrote “Freedom”,

Wrote “Freedom”, wrote “Freedom”.




Chorus




2. 
Freedom is her dogma and her guide;

A thousand times she has defended it,

And as many times has she repelled

The hateful power of atrocious tyranny.

Her history has been bloody and sad,

Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant,

A source of legitimate glory

And a great lesson in Spartan pride.

Her innate bravery shall not waver:

In every man there is an immortal hero

Who knows how to maintain the level

Of the proverbial valour of old.

Valour of old, valour of old.




Chorus




3. 
All are self-denying and faithful

To the tradition of warlike ardour

With which they have always reaped fame

By saving the motherland’s honour.

To respect the rights of others

And base her actions on right and justice

Is for her, without infamous intrigue,

The constant and most firm ambition.

And in following this line she persists,

Dedicating her tenacious efforts

In giving hard battle for battle; 

Her happiness is found in peace, 

Is found in peace, is found in peace.




Chorus
