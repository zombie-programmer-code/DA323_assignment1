1. 
Italian Brothers,

Italy has awakened,

She has wreathed her head

With the helmet of Scipio.

Where is Victory?

She bows her head to you,

You, whom God created

As the 
slave of Rome
.



Italian Brothers,

Italy has awakened,

She has wreathed her head

Where is Victory?

She bows her head to you,

You, whom God created

As the slave of Rome.




CHORUS:

Let us band together,

We are ready to die,

We are ready to die,

Italy has called us.



Let us band together,

We are ready to die,

We are ready to die,

Italy has called us! (Yes!)




2. 
We were for centuries

Downtrodden and derided,

because we are not one people,

because we are divided.

Let one flag, one hope

gather us all.

The hour has struck

for us to join together.




3. 
Let us unite and love one another,

Union and love

Show the people

The way of the Lord.

Let us swear to free

Our native soil;

United under God,

Who can defeat us?




Chorus




4. 
From the Alps  to Sicily,

Legnano is everywhere;

Every man has the heart

and hand of Ferruccio

The children of Italy

Are all called Balilla;

Every trumpet blast

sounds the Vespers.




5. 
Mercenary swords,

theyâ€™re feeble reeds.

The Austrian eagle

Has already lost its plumes.

The blood of Italy

and the Polish blood

It drank, along with the Cossack,

But it burned its heart.




Chorus
