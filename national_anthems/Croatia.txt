1. 
Our beautiful homeland,

Oh dear, heroic land,

Fatherland of ancient glory,

May you always be happy!



Dear, as much as you are glorious,

Only you are dear to us.

Dear, where your land is flat,

Dear, where it is mountainous.




2. 
Flow Sava, Drava flow,

Nor you, Danube, lose your power,

Azure sea, tell to the world

That a Croat loves his nation.



As long as sun warms his ploughed land,

As long as storms lash his oak trees,

As long as the grave hides his dead,

As long as his living heart beats!
