1. 
Where the Alzette flows through the meadows,

The Sura breaks through the crags.

Where the vine fragrant grows along the Moselle,

The sky promises us wine:

There lies the land for which we willingly

Dare everything down here.

Our homeland which we so deeply

Carry in our hearts.

Our homeland which we so deeply

Carry in our hearts.




2. 
O Thou above, Whose powerful hand

Leads the nations through the world,

Protect the Luxembourg land

From foreign yoke and threat.

As children Thou already instilled in us all

The spirit of freedom.

Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,

Shine for evermore.

Let freedom’s sun, which we have known for so long,

Shine for evermore.
