Beloved country,

Pearl of the Orient,

The heartâ€™s fervor,

In your chest is ever alive.



Chosen land,

You are the cradle of the brave.

To the conquerors,

You shall never win.



Through the seas and mountains,

Through the air and your blue sky,

There is splendor in the poem and song

For beloved freedom.



The sparkle of your flag

Is shining victoriously.

Its stars and sun

Shall forever never dim.



Land of the sun, of glory and our affections,

Life is heaven in your arms;

It is our pleasure, when there are oppressors,

To die for you.
