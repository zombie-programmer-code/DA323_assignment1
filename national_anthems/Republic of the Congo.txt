1. 
On this day the sun rises

And our Congo stands resplendent.

A long night is ended,

a great happiness has come.

Let us all, with wild joyfulness, sing

The song of freedom.




CHORUS:
  
Arise, Congolese, proud every man,

Proclaim the unity of our nation.

Let us forget what divides us

And become more united than ever.

Let us live our motto:

Unity, work, progress.

Let us live our motto:

Unity, work, progress.




2. 
From the forest to the bush,

From the bush to the ocean,

One people, one soul,

One heart, ardent and proud.

Let us all fight, every one of us,

For our black country.




Chorus




3. 
And if we have to die,

What does it really matter? Our children

Everywhere will be able to say how

Triumph comes through battle,

And in the smallest village

Sing beneath our three colours.




Chorus
