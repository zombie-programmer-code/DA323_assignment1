CHORUS:

We are free! May we always be so, may we always be so!

and let the sun rather deny its light

its lights, its lights…the sun!

Before allow us to break the solemn vow

which the motherland elevated to the Eternal

Before allow us to break the solemn vow

which the motherland elevated to the Eternal

Before allow us to break the solemn vow

which the motherland elevated to the Eternal.




1. 
For a long time the oppressed Peruvian

dragged the ominous chain;

sentenced to a cruel servitude

for a long time, for a long time

for a long time in silence he moaned.

But as soon as the sacred cry

“Liberty!” was heard on its coasts,

he shook off the indolence of slavery,

the humiliated, the humiliated

the humiliated neck he raised

the humiliated neck he raised

the neck he raised!.




Chorus




2. 
Now the roar of rough chains

that we had heard for three centuries of horror

from the free, at the sacred cry

that the world heard astonished, ceased.

Everywhere the inflamed San Martín

“Liberty”, “Liberty” pronounced;

and the Andes, rocking their base,

announced it as well, in unison.




Chorus




3. 
With its influx the peoples woke up,

and like lighting ran the opinion;

from the Isthmus to Tierra del Fuego,

and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy region.

Everyone vowed to break the link

that Nature denied to both worlds,

and break the sceptre that Spain

had reclined, proud, on both.




Chorus




4. 
Lima fulfilled this solemn vow,

and, severe, her anger showed

by throwing out the powerless tyrant,

who had been trying to extend his oppression.

On her endeavor the shackles cracked,

and the furrows that she had repaired in herself

stirred up her hatred and vengeance,

inherited from her Inca and Lord.




Chorus




5. 
Countrymen, may we see her a slave no more.

If for three centuries she moaned, humiliated,

forever may we vow that she be free,

maintaining her own splendor.

Our arms, until today unarmed,

be they always readying the cannon,

that some day the beaches of Iberia

will feel the horror of its roar.




Chorus




6. 
May we arouse the jealousy of Spain

since it has a premonition, with want and furor,

that in a contest of great nations

our country will enter in comparison.

On the list formed by these

we shall fill the line first,

ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant,

who devastated all of America.




Chorus




7. 
On its summit may the Andes sustain

the two-color flag or standard,

may it announce to the centuries the effort

that being free gave us forever.

Under its shadow may we live calmly

and, at the sun’s birth over its summits,

may we renew the great oath

we rendered to the God of Jacob. 




Chorus
