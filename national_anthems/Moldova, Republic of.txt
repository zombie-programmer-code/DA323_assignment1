1. 
A treasure is our tongue that surges

From deep shadows of the past,

Chain of precious stones that scattered

All over our ancient land.




2. 
A burning flame is our tongue

Amidst a people waking

From a deathly sleep, no warning,

Like the brave man of the stories.




5. 
Our tongue is the greenest leaf

Of the everlasting forests,

Gentle river Nistruâ€™s ripples

Hiding starlight bright and shining.




9. 
Our tongue is more than holy,

Words of homilies of old

Wept and sung perpetually

In the homesteads of our folks.




12. 
A treasure will spring up swiftly

From deep shadows of the past,

Chain of precious stones that scattered

All over our ancient land.
