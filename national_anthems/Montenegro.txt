O the bright dawn of May

O the bright dawn of May

Montenegro our mother 

Montenegro our mother 



We are sons of your rocks

We are sons of your rocks

and keepers of your honesty

and keepers of your honesty



We love you, the rocky hills

and their eerie gorges deep

that had never to endure

the shameful chains of slavery.



Montenegro our mother 

Montenegro our mother

O the bright dawn of May

O the bright dawn of May

Montenegro our mother 

Montenegro our mother 



While our unity gives wings

to our Lovcen cause

it shall brought the pride and glory

to our beloved homeland.



The river of our waves,

that enter the two seas,

shall to ocean guide the voice

Montenegro is eternal.



shall to ocean guide the voice

Montenegro is eternal.



Montenegro is eternal.
