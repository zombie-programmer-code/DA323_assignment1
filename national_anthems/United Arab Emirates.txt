Live my country, the unity of our Emirates lives

You have lived for a nation

Whose religion is Islam and guide is the Qur’an

I made you stronger in God’s name, oh homeland

My country, My country, My country, My country

God has protected you from the evils of the time

We have sworn to build and work

Work sincerely, work sincerely

As long as we live, we will be sincere

The safety has lasted and the flag has lived oh our Emirates

The symbol of Arabism

We all sacrifice for you, we supply you with our blood

We sacrifice for you with our souls oh homeland
