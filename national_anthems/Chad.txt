CHORUS:
  
People of Chad, arise and take up the task!

You have conquered your soil and won your rights;

Your freedom will be born of your courage.

Lift up your eyes, the future is yours



Oh, my Country, may God protect you,

May your neighbours admire your children.

Joyful, peaceful, advance as you sing,

Faithful to your fathers who are watching you.




Chorus
