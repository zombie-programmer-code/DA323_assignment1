CHORUS

We will protect your blood, we sacrifice for you.

We will paint the entire country with the colour of hope.

And when you call, we answer.

We’ve taken a vow, we’ve taken an oath to you.

We joyfully gift you to the next generation.




FINAL CHORUS

We will protect your blood, we sacrifice for you.

We will paint the entire country with the colour of hope.

We will protect your blood, we sacrifice for you.

And when you call, we answer.
