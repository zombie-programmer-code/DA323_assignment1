1. 
Our country’s God! Our country’s God!

We worship Thy name in its wonder sublime.

The suns of the heavens are set in thy crown

By thy legions, the ages of time!

With Thee is each day as a thousand years,

Each thousand of years, but a day.

Eternity’s flow’r, with its homage of tears,

That reverently passes away.

Iceland’s thousand years!

Iceland’s thousand years!

Eternity’s flow’r, with its homage of tears,

That reverently passes away.




2. 
Our God, our God, we bow to Thee,

Our spirits most fervent we place in thy care.

Lord, God of our fathers from age unto age,

We are breathing our holiest prayer.

We pray and we thank Thee a thousand years

For safely protected we stand;

We pray and we bring Thee our homage of tears

Our destiny rest in Thy hand.

Iceland’s thousand years

Iceland’s thousand years

The hoarfrost of morning which tinted those years,

Thy sun rising high, shall command!




3. 
Our country’s God! Our country’s God!

Our life is a feeble and quivering reed;

We perish, deprived of Thy spirit and light

To redeem and uphold in our need.

Inspire us at morn with Thy courage and love,

And lead through the days of our strife!

At evening send peace from Thy heaven above,

And safeguard our nation through life.

Iceland’s thousand years!

Iceland’s thousand years!

O, prosper our people, diminish our tears

And guide, in Thy wisdom, through life!
