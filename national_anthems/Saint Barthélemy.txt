1. 
Isle forgotten by the gods, unknown by the men,

You were sleeping, languid, waiting for a given name,

When the drum of the feet trampling your blond coves,

Tore you out of your dream and opened you to the world.




CHORUS:


Ouanalao
 or Saint Barthélemy

Isle of the Antilles and isle of France

Don’t give up your faith, don’t give up your hope

Your freedom remains our motto




2. 
Arawaks, Caraibes, Bretons and pirates

English, Flemish, French, Spanish and settlers

Canoes, caravelles, galiotes and galions.

Have written your history at the bottom of your bays.




Chorus




3. 
Your children, seamen they were, went from isle to isle

To catch elsewhere the fortune you didn’t give to them

But from the kings’ words, Swedish and then French

They received as inheritance honor and dignity.




Chorus




4. 
Land of hope, of fire, of pain and of spirit

Defying the ocean, the winds, the hurricanes

Without complaint your daughters and sons they rebuild

As their parents have always done before them.




Chorus




5. 
To your barren hills give your beautiful beaches

To your years of drought, your hours of plenty

To your exiled sons their strength and their power

To your moments of doubts the word of the wise men.




Chorus
