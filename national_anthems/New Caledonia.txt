1. 
O sacred land of our ancestors,

Light illuminating our lives,

Prompts you to send us

Their dreams, their hopes, their desires.

Sheltered by pine trees

In the shadow of the glamourous

In the valleys of thy rivers,

Their heart is always present.




CHORUS:


Hnoresaluso ke’j onome

Ha deko ikuja ne enetho

Hue netitonelo kebo kaagu

Ri nodedrane



Let us be united, become brothers,

No more violence or war.

Walk confident and united,

For our country




2. 
Land of dialogue and sharing

You suggest abroad

In the tribe or village

A place to rest.

A wish to stay tolerant,

With fairness and respect

In the hollow of your immense arms 

O Land of freedom.




Chorus




3. 
O land of many faces,

North, South, Iles Loyauté,

Your three provinces are the image

Of your great diversity.

We, your children, we come together,

Tempering our memories.

With one voice, sing together:

Our land, you are our future.




Chorus
