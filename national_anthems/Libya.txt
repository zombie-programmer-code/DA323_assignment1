CHORUS:

Oh my country! With my struggle and my patience

Drive off enemies and mishaps,

And survive!

Survive all through, we are your ransom

Oh Libya! 




1. 
Oh my country! You are the heritage of grandfathers,

May God cast off any hand that would harm you

Do survive! We are for ever your soldiers,

If you survive we care not who perishes.

To you we give solemn pledges

That we, Oh Libya, will never fail you.

We will never go back to fetters, we have been liberated, and we have freed our home country

Libya, Libya, Libya. 




Chorus




2. 
Our grandfathers carried their swords when struggle called on them

Carrying the holy Quran in a hand, and the swords in the other

They fought till they spread religion, peace and prosperity all over the world

Eternity for them

They have built the integrity of our country

Libya, Libya, Libya.




Chorus




3. 
O son of Libya, oh sons of wild lions

We are for glory

And glory is yours

Since we began our struggle, all people were with us

May god protect our independence

Seek the ultimate heights

And be ready for the struggle, our youth

Life is a war for the glory of our home land

Libya, Libya, Libya.




Chorus
