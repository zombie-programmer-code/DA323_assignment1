Mother Sri Lanka




CHORUS:

Our Sri Lanka
 
We salute Thee, Mother!




1. 
Plenteous in prosperity, Thou,
 
Beauteous in grace and love,
 
Laden with corn and luscious fruit
 
And fragrant flowers of radiant hue,
 
Giver of life and all good things,
 
Our land of joy and victory,
 
Receive our grateful praise sublime,
 
We salute Thee, Mother!

2. 
Thou gavest us Knowledge and Truth,
 
Thou art our strength and inward faith,
 
Our light divine and sentient being,
 
Our breath of life and liberation.
 
Grant us, bondage free, inspiration.
 
Inspire us for ever.




3. 
In wisdom and strength renewed,
 
Ill-will, hatred, strife all ended,
 
In love enfolded, a mighty nation
 
Marching onward, all as one,
 
Lead us to fullest freedom
 
We salute Thee, Mother!
