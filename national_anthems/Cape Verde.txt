Sing, brother

Sing, my brother

For Freedom is a hymn

And Man a certainty.



With dignity, bury the seed

In the dust of the naked island:

In life Ã­s precipice

Hope is as big as the sea 

Which embraces us.

Unwavering sentinel of the seas and winds

Between the stars and the Atlantic ocean

Sing the Chant of Freedom.



Sing, brother

Sing, my brother

For Freedom is a hymn

And Man a certainty.
