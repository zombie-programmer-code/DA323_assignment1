1. 
High mountains, valleys and fields

Are our native, holy land.

Our fathers lived amidst the Ala-Toe,

Always saving their motherland.




CHORUS
:

Come on, Kyrgyz people,

Come on to freedom!

Stand up and flourish!

Create your fortune!




2. 
We are open for freedom for ages.

Friendship and unity are in our hearts.

the land of Kyrgyzstan, our native state,

Shining in the rays of consent.




Chorus




3. 
Dreams of the people came true,

And the flag of liberty is over us.

The heritage of our fathers we will

Pass to our sons for the benefit of people.




Chorus
