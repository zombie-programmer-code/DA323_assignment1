1. 
Nigeria we hail thee,

Our own dear native land,

Though tribe and tongue may differ,

In brotherhood we stand,

Nigerians all, are proud to serve

Our sovereign Motherland.




2. 
Our flag shall be a symbol

That truth and justice reign,

In peace or battle honourâ€™d,

And this we count as gain,

To hand on to our children

A banner without stain.




3. 
O God of all creation,

Grant this our one request,

Help us to build a nation

Where no man is oppressed,

And so with peace and plenty

Nigeria may be blessed.
