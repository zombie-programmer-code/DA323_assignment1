1. 
I know a lovely land  

With spreading, shady beeches  

Near Baltic’s salty strand;  

Near Baltic’s salty strand;   

Its hills and valleys gently fall,  

Its ancient name is Denmark,  

And it is Freya’s hall  

And it is Freya’s hall   




2. 
There in the ancient days 
 
The armoured vikings rested  

Between their bloody frays  

Between their bloody frays  

Then they went forth the foe to face,  

Now found in stone-set barrows,  

Their final resting place  

Their final resting place   




3. 
This land is still as fair, 
 
The sea is blue around it,  

And peace is cherished there.  

And peace is cherished there.  

Strong men and noble women still  

Uphold their country’s honour  

With faithfulness and skill  

With faithfulness and skill   




4. 
Hail King and Fatherland

Hail every Danish person 

For doing what he can

For doing what he can 

The Viking land for Danes is true  

With fields and waving beeches  

By a sea so blue  

By a sea so blue
