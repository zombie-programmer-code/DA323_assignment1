1. 
O Fatherland, we shall never forget

The heroes of the Fourth of February.

O Fatherland, we salute your sons

Who died for our Independence.

We honour the past and our history

As by our work we build the New Man.

We honour the past and our history

As by our work we build the New Man.




CHORUS
:


Forward, Angola!

Revolution through the power of the People!

A United Country, Freedom,

One People, one Nation!

Forward, Angola!

Revolution through the power of the People!

A United Country, Freedom,

One People, one Nation!




2. 
Let us raise our liberated voices

To the glory of the peoples of Africa.

We shall march, Angolan fighters,

In solidarity with oppressed peoples.

We shall fight proudly for Peace

Along with the progressive forces of the world.

We shall fight proudly for Peace

Along with the progressive forces of the world.
