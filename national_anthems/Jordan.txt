Long live the King!

Long live the King!

His position is sublime,

His banners waving in glory supreme.




1. 
We achieved our goal,

On the day you gave us the mark,

A revolution gives us our motivation!

Flying over the shoulders of the highest comets.




CHORUS:

Oh! You king of Arabs,

From the best prophet you have.

The honour of dynasty,

Talked about in the depths of books!




2. 
All the youthful men,

Are your armed armies

His ditermination never dies out!

Getting from you the manners you have




Chorus




3. 
May you stay the light and the guide,

A master in being away of all sins and wrong-doing,

Living your life happily and well-respected!

Under your flying flag rests the glory of all Arabs.




Chorus
