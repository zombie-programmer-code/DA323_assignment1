CHORUS:

Eastern landsmen, our country or the grave!

Freedom, or with glory to die.

Eastern landsmen, our country or the grave!

Freedom, or with glory to die.

This is the vow that our souls take

And which we know how, courageously, to fulfil,

This is the vow that our souls take

And which we know how, courageously, to fulfil,

Know how to fulfil,

This is the vow that our souls take

And which we know how, courageously, to fulfil,

Know how to fulfil!

Know how to fulfil!

Know how to fulfil!




1. 
Freedom, freedom, eastern landsmen,

This cry saved our country,

Inflaming its brave men

With enthusiasm in fierce battles.

Freedom, freedom, eastern landsmen,

This cry saved our country,

Inflaming its brave men

With enthusiasm in fierce battles.

We merited the glory of this sacred gift.

Let tyrants tremble!

Let tyrants tremble!

Let tyrants tremble!

Ah, in the fight we shall clamour for freedom

And, dying still cry for it,

And, dying still cry for it,

Still cry for it,

Still cry for it.
